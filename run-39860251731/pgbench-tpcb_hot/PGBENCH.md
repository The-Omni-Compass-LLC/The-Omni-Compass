Native is PostgreSQL as shipped behind PgBouncer's shipped pool of 20 server connections; omni is the same with the compass law writing the pool size through PgBouncer's own console inside [2, 90], handed back at the end. The load is pgbench, rate-limited, stepping one notch at a time, the peak notch offering native's own unlimited capacity. Every row is shown, losses included; a 95% interval of the paired difference (omni minus native) over the repetitions decides whether a change is beyond the noise. There is no watt-meter on the machine: the host's CPU-seconds are measured, no energy is claimed (`docs/POSTGRES_PREREGISTRATION.md`).

## tpcb_hot (tpcb (default), scale 2): line 50 ms, 3 paired repetitions

Native capacity, unlimited: 1,863 tps; base rate 279 tps; steps [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1] × 30 s; 64 clients. Engine omni-v16 (digest 5c5502f12b1c0ce4, 55 files) at `15915c961cd2`.

| Gauge | native | omni | change (95% interval) | reading |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| work inside the response line (transactions a second answered within the line) | 818.8 | 817.8 | -0.1% (-1.3 to +1.1) | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| throughput (transactions a second) | 820.7 | 819.8 | -0.1% (-1.0 to +0.8) | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, 95th percentile (ms, lag included) | 6.15 | 6.14 | -0.2% (-22.6 to +22.2) | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, 99th percentile (ms) | 14.0 | 14.7 | +5.3% (-59.1 to +69.6) | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, median (ms) | 1.93 | 1.93 | +0.2% (-1.9 to +2.2) | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, mean (ms) | 2.96 | 2.96 | +0.1% (-50.2 to +50.3) | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| failed transactions | 0 | 0 | +0 (+0 to +0) | EVEN, the same |
| server connections alive, mean (the machines) | 19.5 | 18.4 | -5.9% (-15.3 to +3.6) | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| server connections alive, most at once | 20.0 | 20.3 | +1.7% (-5.5 to +8.8) | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU busy (share of the run) | 0.229 | 0.23 | +0.4% (-3.8 to +4.5) | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds | 357.5 | 358.8 | +0.4% (-3.9 to +4.6) | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds per 1,000 transactions inside the line | 0.97 | 0.975 | +0.5% (-2.6 to +3.6) | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| the harness's own CPU-seconds (the compass's brain in the omni arm, the sampler in both; inside the host's) | 0.758 | 1.49 | +97.1% (+90.1 to +104.0) | shown, not judged |
| pool size, mean (the knob) | 20.0 | 18.9 | -5.5% (-7.3 to -3.7) | shown, not judged |

The knob handed back and read back at the end of every omni arm: yes; a foreign writer seen: no; Omni's writes per arm: 33, 11, 29; fail-ups per arm: 1, 0, 0.

Per repetition (inside the line tps / p95 ms / servers alive / pool mean):

- rep 1 (native then omni): native 821 / 6.4 / 20.0 / 20.0; omni 816 / 6.5 / 18.6 / 19.0
- rep 2 (omni then native): native 819 / 6.3 / 18.6 / 20.0; omni 818 / 5.7 / 18.3 / 19.0
- rep 3 (native then omni): native 816 / 5.8 / 20.0 / 20.0; omni 819 / 6.3 / 18.3 / 18.7
