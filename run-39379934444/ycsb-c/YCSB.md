MongoDB as shipped with the operator's WiredTiger cache (512 MB) is native; omni is the compass law on the cache size through the server's own console inside [256, 2048] MB, holding the server's own read latency at 40% of the 1 ms line. YCSB's published core workloads, the same operations in both arms, the key space stepping through the cache and past it. Memory held is the resource; the host's CPU seconds include the compass's own cost. Every row is reported, losses included.

MongoDB 8.0.34, YCSB 0.17.0; 3,000 operations a second offered from 32 threads; 3 paired repetitions; engine omni-v12 (digest d38b58fbe28939b8, 47 files) at `690b955b1c2a`.

| Gauge | native | omni | change | 95% interval of the difference | reading |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| work inside the response line (operations a second answered within the line) | 2,895 | 2,894 | -0.1% | -4.02 to 0.583 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| throughput (operations a second) | 2,900 | 2,898 | -0.0% | -3.02 to 0.216 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, 95th percentile (ms) | 0.316 | 0.316 | +0.0% | -0.00745 to 0.00745 | EVEN, the same |
| latency, 99th percentile (ms) | 0.502 | 0.508 | +1.3% | -0.0188 to 0.0322 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, mean (ms) | 0.196 | 0.199 | +1.3% | -0.00276 to 0.0077 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| failed operations | 0 | 0 |  | 0 to 0 | EVEN, the same |
| cache size held, mean (MB; the knob, the resource) | 512 | 499 | -2.5% | -32.3 to 6.79 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| bytes in the cache, mean (MB) | 418 | 408 | -2.4% | -27 to 6.91 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| pages read into the cache (misses) | 704,656 | 690,279 | -2.0% | -159,592 to 130,839 | shown, not judged |
| host CPU busy (share of the run) | 0.196 | 0.178 | -9.5% | -0.0742 to 0.037 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds | 344 | 305 | -11.4% | -156 to 77.4 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds per 1,000 operations inside the line | 0.258 | 0.229 | -11.4% | -0.117 to 0.0582 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| cache size changes written (the knob's moves) | 0 | 3.33 |  | 1.9 to 4.77 | shown, not judged |

Every omni arm handed back to the operator's cache size: yes; another writer seen: no; fail-ups: 0.
