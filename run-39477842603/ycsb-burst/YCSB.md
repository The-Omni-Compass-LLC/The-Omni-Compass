MongoDB as shipped with the operator's WiredTiger cache (512 MB) is native; omni is the compass law on the cache size through the server's own console inside [256, 2048] MB, holding the server's own read latency at 40% of the 1 ms line. YCSB's published core workloads, the same operations in both arms, the key space stepping through the cache and past it. Memory held is the resource; the host's CPU seconds include the compass's own cost. Every row is reported, losses included.

## burst: YCSB workloadb, 250,000 records × notch, steps 1 6 1 8 1 6 × 30.0 s

MongoDB 8.0.34, YCSB 0.17.0; 3,000 operations a second offered from 32 threads; 3 paired repetitions; engine omni-v12 (digest d38b58fbe28939b8, 47 files) at `fb90309cad0d`.

| Gauge | native | omni | change | 95% interval of the difference | reading |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| work inside the response line (operations a second answered within the line) | 2,897 | 2,897 | -0.0% | -5.88 to 5.03 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| throughput (operations a second) | 2,902 | 2,900 | -0.0% | -2.41 to -0.219 | LOSS |
| latency, 95th percentile (ms) | 0.362 | 0.363 | +0.4% | -0.00154 to 0.0042 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, 99th percentile (ms) | 0.486 | 0.481 | -1.0% | -0.04 to 0.0307 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, mean (ms) | 0.2 | 0.196 | -1.9% | -0.0217 to 0.014 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| failed operations | 0 | 0 |  | 0 to 0 | EVEN, the same |
| cache size held, mean (MB; the knob, the resource) | 512 | 503 | -1.8% | -14 to -4.49 | GAIN |
| bytes in the cache, mean (MB) | 405 | 398 | -1.6% | -15.1 to 1.95 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| pages read into the cache (misses) | 262,964 | 263,921 | +0.4% | -7,087 to 9,002 | shown, not judged |
| host CPU busy (share of the run) | 0.219 | 0.198 | -9.5% | -0.102 to 0.0603 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds | 160 | 141 | -11.9% | -92.7 to 54.5 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds per 1,000 operations inside the line | 0.301 | 0.265 | -12.0% | -0.174 to 0.102 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| cache size changes written (the knob's moves) | 0 | 4 |  | 4 to 4 | shown, not judged |

Every omni arm handed back to the operator's cache size: yes; another writer seen: no; fail-ups: 0.
