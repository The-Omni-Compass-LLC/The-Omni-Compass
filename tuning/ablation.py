"""What each mechanism contributes. The confirmatory setting (tuning/GLOBAL_LEAGUE_PREREGISTRATION.json) against
versions with one mechanism removed, on 30 fresh scenarios per workload (seeds 711001-711030), paired:
  gate_off      the six-state engine's equation-(2) push no longer gates releases (push_release = infinity)
  no_turn       releases no longer wait for the turning point (Chapters 29-30)
  no_tone       released machines are powered off instead of parked (no warm reserve)
  no_trend      the dual bath's rate is removed (b = 0: level only, no forecast of the trend)
  no_closure    the closure law is removed; machines follow the engine-driven speed governor (the earlier C)
Reported: mean change of every gauge against the full law (positive = the removal made it worse) with a paired 95%
bootstrap interval, plus contradictions (controllers fighting, quick reversals). Usage: python tuning/ablation.py"""
