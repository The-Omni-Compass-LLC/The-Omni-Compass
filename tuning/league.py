"""League table: every competitor against Omni-Compass, one at a time, on every gauge and every vessel.

Rule (the owner's): Omni-Compass must be equal or better than EACH competitor on EACH gauge. A cell is a loss when the
competitor is better by more than the tolerance AND the paired bootstrap 95% interval excludes zero. Every loss goes on
the attack list.

Competitors, each at its documented defaults (fleet plant with response time, fleet/sim_slo.py; vendor arms emulate
documented behaviour, not the vendors' binaries):
  k8s_hpa70_ca   Kubernetes: HPA (70%, the target of every earlier study) + Cluster Autoscaler (= GKE balanced)
  openshift, gke_optimize, aks_nap (= Karpenter, also EKS Auto Mode), turbonomic, cast_ai, spot_ocean
Omni-Compass: one configuration per vessel type (web, multi, batch, gpu), chosen from the candidates below as the one with
the fewest losses on the development seeds. The operator declaring the vessel type is a human-set boundary.
Usage: python tuning/league.py [dev|heldout] [candidates.json]
