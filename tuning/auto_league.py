"""The self-calibrating closure law (omnicompass/closure.py AutoClosureLaw) against all seven platforms. No setting is
tuned per workload: the law derives its horizons from the boot delay and the park break-even, its margin from the
measured forecast error and the engine's stress, and packs to the physical boundary. The only global choice is the pod
rule (declared here, the same for every workload). Multi-cluster sites run the law on the site total with traffic shift.
Usage: python tuning/auto_league.py dev|heldout  ->  tuning/AUTO_LEAGUE_{DEV,HELDOUT}.json"""
