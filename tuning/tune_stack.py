"""Tune allocation-law variants that remove the negatives of the pre-registered stack benchmark, on DEVELOPMENT seeds only.

The frozen engine files are not edited (verify.py fingerprints them). Variants are law overrides applied on top of the
frozen modes:
  B  (omni_k8s_throughput, Omni on top of Kubernetes): overrides applied after the throughput mode
  C  (omni_direct, Omni direct):                        overrides applied to the base law
Objective, against k8s_ref_70 on the same scenarios: energy at least 10% lower, time healthy not lower, and as few
gauges worse than Kubernetes as possible (wear, queue, node-hours, reversals first). Development seeds 1000 and 2000 are
the seeds the original constants were selected on; held-out seeds are never touched here.
