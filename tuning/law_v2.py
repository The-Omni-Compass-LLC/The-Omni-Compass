"""Prototype law v2: two structural changes to how the engine's directive becomes actions (adapter.directive_to_actions
is frozen and is not edited; v2 wraps it).

1. Replicas (direct actuation) are sized with the engine's own sizing equation, the one it uses for nodes:
       r* = ceil(r * load / rho* + kq * q * r)
   and may rise whenever there is backlog, not only when the node decision points up.
2. The power cap moves only when the change exceeds a dead-band AND the equation (2) control push has converged
   (|push| <= push_release), the same gate the engine applies to releasing capacity; raising the cap is never delayed.
