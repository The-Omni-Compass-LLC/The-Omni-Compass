"""One global closure-law setting for every workload (no per-workload table). Candidates: each workload's frozen
setting from tuning/CLOSURE_FINAL_DEV.json applied to all four workloads (pods at 0.8 for services; job workloads have no
pods to size). Four-cluster sites run the same law on the site total with traffic shift. Selection on 30 development
seeds (101-130) by total losing cells against the seven platforms; the pick is frozen by SHA-256 and run once on fresh
held-out seeds 703001-703030. Usage: python tuning/global_league.py  ->  tuning/GLOBAL_LEAGUE.json"""
