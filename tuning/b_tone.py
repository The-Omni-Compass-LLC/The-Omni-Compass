"""Architecture B, second generation: muscle tone and consolidation on top of each platform. For every (workload,
platform) the candidates are the frozen B setting (tuning/B_SETTINGS_PER_PLATFORM.json) and that setting plus
  tone     the platform's power-offs become parks (instant wake), reserve horizon tone_H at packing tone_rho
  pack     Omni consolidates on top: remove a machine when the rest hold every request at this packing, after calm
Selection on development seeds: no losing cell under the strict tolerance (0.25%), then the largest total gain (losses
penalised x3), so the result can only be equal to or better than the frozen B. Held-out on fresh seeds 700401-700430.
Usage: python tuning/b_tone.py dev   ->  tuning/B_SETTINGS_TONE.json
       python tuning/b_tone.py heldout  ->  tuning/B_TONE_HELDOUT.json (frozen by SHA-256 in B_TONE_PREREGISTRATION.json)"""
