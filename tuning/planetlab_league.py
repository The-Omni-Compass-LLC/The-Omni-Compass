"""Real demand: recorded PlanetLab VM CPU traces (github.com/beloglazov/planetlab-workload-traces, day 20110303, 1,052
machines) as web-service demand (fleet/planetlab.py), Omni-Compass alone with the frozen web closure-law setting
(tuning/CLOSURE_FINAL_DEV.json, never tuned on these traces) against the seven platforms, league loss rule, 30 scenarios.
Also runs the same comparison with whole-pod packing (fleet/sim_slo.py PACKING = "bins").
Usage: python tuning/planetlab_league.py /path/to/20110303  ->  tuning/PLANETLAB_LEAGUE.json"""
