"""Sixth closure pass (muscle tone: released machines are parked alive at low power with instant wake, a warm
reserve sized by the law; only machines beyond it are powered off). Built on the fifth pass: the two remaining negatives, attacked with the manuscript's math and queueing theory, around the
frozen energy-first settings (tuning/CLOSURE_FINAL_DEV.json):
  flipping   the deviation-bath band z (Chapter 31): a release must survive z standard deviations of the tracker's
             innovation over the release horizon; plus release hysteresis delta_rel and calm dwell
  response   square-root staffing (Halfin-Whitt) beta: replicas = busy + beta sqrt(busy) (web, multi)
Selection (development seeds, every variant kept): fewest energy/machine-hour losing cells, then fewest losing cells,
then smallest total gap. Usage: python tuning/closure_search6.py  ->  tuning/CLOSURE_SEARCH6_DEV.json"""
