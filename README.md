## Latest, newest first

Everything between the markers below is written by the repository itself (`tools/front_page.py`, run by
`.github/workflows/front-page.yml` within minutes of every finished benchmark run, and every hour besides): no person moves
it, and nothing older than the newest result stands in front of it. Earlier front pages are kept whole in `docs/history/`.

<!-- front-page:status:begin -->
- **Engine on main:** omni-v3, fingerprint `b53d05449ee04c4b` (40 files); package 0.3.0. Omni v4 (the reflex rule on every wire) is designed in [`docs/OMNI_V4_PLAN.md`](docs/OMNI_V4_PLAN.md) and not yet built; every result runs again on it when it is.
- **The Omni index now:** +4.8% on the resource reading (work, speed, machines and energy) and +10.7% on the service reading (work and speed), real machines, every test confirmed three times ([`results/OMNI_INDEX.md`](results/OMNI_INDEX.md)).

**Two names only: native is the system as it runs on its own; omni is Omni-Compass on top of native.** Omni-Compass never
replaces native; every comparison is native against omni.

## The result on real Kubernetes

Omni-Compass on top of native Kubernetes, real clusters, ten paired runs per test, on **Omni v3**, the frozen and
fingerprinted engine ([`docs/OMNI_V3.md`](docs/OMNI_V3.md): v1's law and controllers byte for byte, the muscle catalog grown to 945 and a do-no-harm gate on speed knobs; the v1 tables, [`docs/OMNI_V1.md`](docs/OMNI_V1.md), read the same and stay as the first engine's record). Every test ran three times as separate GitHub runs (A the
result, B and C the replications); a reading below is **confirmed** only when it holds in all three runs with every 95%
interval clear of zero, and otherwise reads no difference beyond the noise. The six tables:
[`V3_ALL_FOUR`](results/live/V3_ALL_FOUR.md), [`V3_STEADY`](results/live/V3_STEADY.md),
[`V3_WANDERING`](results/live/V3_WANDERING.md), [`V3_FAULTS`](results/live/V3_FAULTS.md),
[`V3_BATCH`](results/live/V3_BATCH.md), [`V3_FAIRNESS`](results/live/V3_FAIRNESS.md).

| | native (run A) | omni (run A) | Reading over the three runs |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| **Work handled inside the response line** (all four in one run) | 21.0 req/s | **31.2 req/s** | **+35% to +49% more work on the same machines, confirmed better** |
| **Response time, 95th percentile** (steady, wandering, all four, faults) | 321-820 ms | 111-306 ms | **−47% to −66% in every run of all four tests, confirmed better** |
| **Failed requests** (wandering, all four) | 8.9-12.3% | 7.7-10.9% | **−9% to −14%, confirmed better**; zero in both arms at steady load; under faults lower in all three, clear of the noise in one |
| **Machines in service** | 6 | 5.90 (steady), 4.89 (batch) | steady **−1.5% to −2.9%** and batch **−19% to −23%, confirmed better**; the other tests no difference beyond the noise |
| **Energy** (a declared model: on kind the machines are containers on one runner, so a machine out of service saves modelled watts, not a metered bill) | | | standby model confirmed lower in steady (−1.3% to −2.1%) and batch (−13% to −16%); elsewhere no difference beyond the noise |
| **A noisy neighbour on the same workers** (fairness) | | | no difference beyond the noise on every row, the neighbour's own service included: Omni neither helps nor hurts |
| **Pods left with no machine to take them** | 0 | 0 | same, in every test |

Omni gives a machine back only after a paired trial shows the service is no slower without it (the verdict). On these
clusters one machine fewer made each request 30-45% slower in most trials, so Omni kept the machines and spent them on
speed and work. Earlier engines without that check parked 29-36% of the machines (`docs/history/`); the frozen engine
puts work and speed first.

**Not yet shown**, stated as plainly as the gains: an energy or cloud-bill saving on real machines (Azure's bill did not
move on the earlier engines, [`AKS_BILL`](results/live/AKS_BILL.md) and [`V1_AKS_STEADY`](results/live/V1_AKS_STEADY.md):
every gauge inside the noise), and the current card governor on a real GPU (the one real-card run, on a governor since
replaced, saved 1.6-3.5% of the card's energy and made its 95th percentile 43-84% slower:
[`HIL_RESCORED`](results/hil/run-20261002T082232Z/HIL_RESCORED.md)). The five live products, the index and every row,
losses included, are in [`results/OMNI_INDEX.md`](results/OMNI_INDEX.md), [`docs/BENEFIT_SHEET.md`](docs/BENEFIT_SHEET.md)
and [`docs/WIRING_VERDICTS.md`](docs/WIRING_VERDICTS.md), each rebuilt from the tables by the repository itself.

## The manual: the book for the people who wire it

[`docs/OMNI_COMPASS_MANUAL.pdf`](docs/OMNI_COMPASS_MANUAL.pdf) is Omni-Compass as a printed book, built from the
repository whenever it changes (`docs/book/build_book.py`): front matter with the card for the glove box, the theory of
the mechanism, the wiring instructions level by level and stack by stack (Kubernetes, databases, message brokers, caches,
GPUs, the processor itself, the data center under the servers, robots and drones), operating it, proving it, and back
matter. Its text is [`docs/OMNI_COMPASS_MANUAL.md`](docs/OMNI_COMPASS_MANUAL.md). It is written for the CTO who decides,
the engineer who wires, the operator who runs a data center, and the auditor who checks.

## What is real and what is a model

| Evidence | What runs | Class |
|---|---|---|
| Real Kubernetes on GitHub | Kubernetes itself (API server, scheduler, its own autoscaler), a real web service, real requests, real response times and CPU. The machines are containers on one runner; energy there is a declared formula, not a meter | L |
| Real cloud, Azure AKS | All of the above on real Azure machines, Azure's own autoscaler, Azure's billed machine count | L |
| Real card, NVIDIA A10 on Lambda | The card's power limit and clocks, its own power meter, real GPU work. The first run (2026-10-02) used a card controller since replaced (it answered slower); the current controller's run is next | P |
| The 945 muscles | Software models of real control systems (AI serving, cooling, batteries, robot joints, grids), each from its maker's specification. They show the mechanism; they are labelled as models wherever they appear | S |

## How it works

Omni-Compass is a supervisory governor. It does not replace your autoscaler or your firmware: it sits on top, reads
the meters of each muscle (response time, utilisation, power, heat), holds each muscle's own setting in the middle of
its band with one bounded law, and hands every setting back the moment it stops. As demand rises, the warm machines
take it first; as it falls, the emptiest machine idles first, powered and ready, never switched off, and never below a floor of two (idle). The reset hands every setting back at
the end of a run; the kill switch, a separate security switch, turns Omni-Compass off everywhere at once. The law, its
proof and its wiring: [`docs/MECHANISM_OF_ACTION.md`](docs/MECHANISM_OF_ACTION.md),
[`docs/TRACKING_THEOREM.md`](docs/TRACKING_THEOREM.md), [`docs/CONVEYANCE_LAW.md`](docs/CONVEYANCE_LAW.md).

## Check it yourself

```
pip install -r requirements.txt && python verify.py      # must end: VERIFICATION: PASS
bash scripts/run_live_local.sh 3                          # native against omni on your own kind cluster
sudo bash scripts/gpu_rented_run.sh                       # the card run, on any rented NVIDIA machine
```

`verify.py` reruns every held-out result byte for byte, the Python and C++ twins, the property tests, and checks that
the repository is lined up (`tools/layout_check.py`). Every live result carries its raw files and SHA-256 digests.
