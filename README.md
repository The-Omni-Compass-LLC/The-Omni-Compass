**New here? Read [`START_HERE.md`](START_HERE.md) first:** the reading order, the receipts, and how to run everything yourself.

A six-state control engine that supervises Kubernetes and hardware from above: Kubernetes and its autoscalers stay the
execution layer.

The Omni-Compass LLC · [www.omni-compass.com](https://www.omni-compass.com) · Topics: `omni-compass` `governor` `control-plane` `kubernetes` `autoscaling` `gpu` `energy-efficiency` `work-per-energy` `data-center` `power-management` `control-theory` `source-available`

**New to these tables?** [`docs/HOW_TO_READ_THE_RESULTS.md`](docs/HOW_TO_READ_THE_RESULTS.md) explains every column of every result, in plain words. The full grid of the six organisms at 1, 10, 100 and 1,000 clusters is [`results/scale/GRID.md`](results/scale/GRID.md) (`python3 tools/grid.py` rebuilds it).

**Read first: [`DISCLOSURES.md`](DISCLOSURES.md).** Every declaration, disclosure and disclaimer is made there once,
including the wiring declaration: Omni-Compass acts only through the wires it is given, it cannot be slapped on, and if
your paired receipts differ from the published benchmarks in direction, the first presumption is wiring (manual,
section 8.5).

**Where it stands, plainly.** Omni-Compass is a supervisory governor. It reads the meters of each muscle, holds each
muscle's own setting in the middle of its band with one bounded law, and hands every setting back when it stops. It
does not replace your autoscaler or your firmware; it sits on top, in watch mode first.

| Measured | Result | Class |
|---|---|---|
| Real Kubernetes, sets 22-27, 10 paired runs each, same work | machines in service −29% to −36%, p95 −55% to −65%, 0 failed requests, every set proven; total CPU including Omni's own: no difference | L |
| Real NVIDIA A10, 10 paired runs, the card's own meter | work per energy **+3.6%** (proven), energy −3.5%, same requests; p95 **+58.5% worse**, a wiring fault in the governor, found in the card's own samples and corrected (`docs/GPU_PREREGISTRATION.md`, amendments 6-7) | P |
| The card's firmware alone vs with Omni on top, modelled card (tuning / fresh seeds) | AI token generation: energy −3.3% / −3.7%, median +0.6% / +0.7%; compute-bound: energy −0.7% / −0.5%, median +1.6% / +1.5%; no step more than 2% slower per request | S |
| Six organisms (656 muscles), 1-1,000 runs, 1× and 10× size, round 3 law | work per energy +0.20% to +0.31% in every cell; time over the service line +0.2 points (band first not held) | S |
| Six organisms, round 6 law (cause found and corrected), 20 paired seeds each | work per energy +0.09% to +0.20%; time over the line better than native in all six; grid rerun next | S |

Everything, with charts: [`docs/DOSSIER.md`](docs/DOSSIER.md). All 656 muscles, what each is for and how it is wired: [`docs/MUSCLE_CATALOG.md`](docs/MUSCLE_CATALOG.md). Licensing in plain answers: [`LICENSING_FAQ.md`](LICENSING_FAQ.md). Where everything stands: [`STATE_OF_PLAY.md`](STATE_OF_PLAY.md).
On kind, energy is a declared model, not a meter. The corrected GPU governor's real-card run is next: one command on a
rented NVIDIA machine, `sudo bash scripts/gpu_rented_run.sh` (`docs/GPU_RUN_GUIDE.md`).

## What each piece of evidence establishes, and what it does not

| Piece | What it establishes | What it does not establish |
|---|---|---|
| The engine equations (`omnicompass/core.py`) | The proposed governing mechanism | That it describes any real system |
| RK4 with microsteps | The equations executed numerically, with small step error | Anything outside the equations |
| Cross-check against a second solver | The result is not an artifact of RK4 or its step size | Anything outside the equations |
| Many sampled runs (Monte Carlo) | No failure seen over the sampled starting states and parameters | Behaviour outside the sample, or on real systems |
| Dwell tests (basin capture and retention) | Objective pass/fail tests of trajectories inside the model | Any external certification |  
| Ablations, sensitivity, disturbance tests | Which parts of the mechanism matter, and how it recovers, inside the model | Real-world recovery |
| Python / C++ parity | Two independent implementations compute the same thing | That either is right about the world |
| Shield adversarial tests, 100M-decision soak | The safety logic holds under generated bad inputs; the code runs long without failing | Behaviour under real faults |
| Fleet and cluster simulators (`fleet/`, `k8s_controlplane/`) | Behaviour against modelled plants with declared assumptions | Real savings; the plant and Omni are in the same program |
| Live Kubernetes on kind (`results/live/LIVE_PAIRED.md`) | Omni changes a real control plane: faster responses, fewer pod starts, zero failures, a clean kill switch | Energy or money: kind has no meter and every machine stayed on |
| GPU bench (`scripts/gpu_rented_run.sh`, `scripts/gpu_paired.sh`) | Run once on a real A10 (2026-10-02): energy saved, proven, and the slowest answers slower because of a wiring fault since corrected. Real joules from the card's own meter | That the corrected governor holds response time on a real card (its run is next); other cards |
| Production data centre | Not run | |

Dollar figures computed by multiplying modelled per-stack coefficients are not results and do not appear here.

**The manual:** [`docs/OMNI_COMPASS_MANUAL.pdf`](docs/OMNI_COMPASS_MANUAL.pdf), the printable book (294 pages, covers to back cover): the philosophy and theory, the mathematics, the physics, the 656 muscles, the harness, how to wire it onto your stack step by step, how to operate it, every result, the license and the source of the engine. Its text in one file: [`docs/book/OMNI_COMPASS_BOOK.md`](docs/book/OMNI_COMPASS_BOOK.md); the short manual: [`docs/OMNI_COMPASS_MANUAL.md`](docs/OMNI_COMPASS_MANUAL.md). One page of every command: [`HANDOFF.md`](HANDOFF.md).


0. **`docs/ENGINES.md`**: there is one engine (`omnicompass/core.py`), its C++ twin, and two frozen originals. Nothing
   else runs.
1. **`STATE_OF_PLAY.md`**: every claim, where its evidence is, and what still loses. Simulation results and live
   results are labelled separately.
2. **Reproduce everything:** `pip install -r requirements.txt && python verify.py` must end `VERIFICATION: PASS`. It
   reruns every held-out result byte for byte, the C++ twin parity check and the property tests.
3. **Run it live on your Kubernetes:** `bash RUN_LIVE.sh 3` on any machine with Docker and kind. It compares native,
   Omni-Compass on top and Omni-Compass alone on real 7-node clusters. On a production cluster, start with the
   read-only shadow kit (`docs/PILOT_KIT.md`), which can make no changes.

## Engine interpretation notice

The Omni-Compass engine is the completed core conveyance mechanism. Its success criterion is internal dual-basin
conveyance under native ignition dynamics. It is not a generic single-target controller, and it does not require an
added bridge to validate its core function. External module wiring, orchestration, and deployment-specific adaptation
(the Kubernetes adapters, the closure governor `omnicompass/closure.py`, the fleet arms) are separate engineering
responsibilities performed around the engine, not inside the base law. Parameter tuning of that wiring is allowed;
reclassifying the core law is not. The reference engine `reference/omni_compass_reference_engine.py` and
`omnicompass/core.py` are byte-locked by SHA-256 (`reference/PROVENANCE.json`) and are not edited by any bench.

## Lab: real Kubernetes runs

Two ways to run Omni-Compass on a real Kubernetes control plane (kind: real API server, scheduler, HPA,
metrics-server). Each run does: baseline (HPA alone, Omni observing and writing nothing), Omni in target
mode, kill-switch restore check, then a scored comparison.

| Workflow | Cluster | Omni-Compass drives | Start it |
|---|---|---|---|
| `live-kind` | 1 node | HPA target | Actions → live-kind → Run workflow, or `[kind]` in a commit message |
| `benchmark` | two identical 6-worker clusters side by side | nothing (native) vs HPA target + node pool + power | Actions → benchmark → Run workflow, or `[bench]` in a commit message; writes `BENCHMARK.md` |
| `live-kind-full` | 1 control plane + 6 workers | HPA target, node pool (cordon/drain/uncordon), power sensing | Actions → live-kind-full → Run workflow, or `[full]` in a commit message |

Results appear on each run's summary page and as an artifact. Locally (Docker Desktop): `docker compose up --build`
runs `live-kind`; results land in `lab_results/run_<date>/`.

Evidence discipline in `benchmark` (pattern from the ChatGPT-built pilot harness, extended to every muscle): pinned,
SHA-256-checked metrics-server; preflight record; clean-cluster check; Omni-Compass runs as a least-privilege service
account (`deploy/kind/rbac-omni.yaml`, via `scripts/kubectl_omni.sh`) with `kubectl auth can-i` receipts
(`rbac_omni.txt`); the run fails if Omni made no write or the kill switch leaves a record; `SHA256SUMS.txt` over every
output file.

Full-engine run (`scripts/kind_full.sh`): baseline on all workers with Omni observing (must write nothing), then
Omni drives the wired muscles, then the kill switch must restore the HPA target and return every worker to service.
Limits: a parked kind worker is a cordoned, drained container, counted as off; power is a declared model
(`scripts/kind_power.sh`, the same constants `pilot/score.py` uses), not a meter. Energy numbers from kind are modelled.

## Verify

pip install -r requirements.txt
python verify.py          # full
python verify.py --quick  # abbreviated
```

## Results on 1,000 held-out scenarios

Seeds 346410161 / 360555127, 500 scenarios each, generated from `results/heldout_seed_*/SUMMARY.json`. The Kubernetes baseline is a documented-behaviour reference model, not the upstream controllers, run at HPA targets 0.5 to 0.8 (manual Section 8.3). Throughput mode applies the same power rules as the reference and is the like-for-like comparison; power-protect additionally enforces the site power limit. With the governor in observe mode, Kubernetes runs bit-identically to Kubernetes alone (500/500 and 500/500).

| | Kubernetes reference (HPA 0.7) | Omni + Kubernetes, power-protect | Omni + Kubernetes, throughput |

## Fleet harness: 15-second Kubernetes control plane (`fleet/`)

metrics-server, HPA, Cluster Autoscaler and Karpenter-lite at their documented cadence over many workloads per cluster. Five vessels in two families: elastic (web, multi, batch, gpu: nodes may be powered off) and always-on (gpu_always_on: power-off not permitted, idle nodes may only be parked). Omni-Compass is the node-pool and power authority in place of the Cluster Autoscaler (HPA retained), decisions every 60 s, in four settings: energy-first, balanced and wear-first (the equation (2) gate at increasing strength) and park (capacity reductions executed as parking: Ready, 25% of idle power). 30 held-out scenarios per vessel from seed 700000; observe mode bit-identical to HPA + CA in all. Workloads are synthetic.

| Vessel | Setting | Energy vs HPA 0.7 + CA | Energy vs HPA 0.7 + Karpenter-lite | Machines powered off (Omni / CA / Karpenter) | Park moves |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| web | energy-first | -34.5% (better) | -16.9% (better) | 10.9 / 7.7 / 13.5 | 0.0 |
| web | balanced | -33.2% (better) | -15.3% (better) | 10.4 / 7.7 / 13.5 | 0.0 |

| multi | park | -15.6% (better) | +7.0% (worse) | 0.0 / 32.4 / 54.0 | 61.8 |
| batch | energy-first | -17.2% (better) | -9.7% (better) | 26.4 / 1.9 / 43.0 | 0.0 |
| batch | balanced | -12.4% (better) | -4.5% (better) | 15.2 / 1.9 / 43.0 | 0.0 |
| batch | wear-first | -12.3% (better) | -4.3% (better) | 13.3 / 1.9 / 43.0 | 0.0 |
| batch | park | -15.3% (better) | -7.7% (better) | 0.0 / 1.9 / 43.0 | 41.7 |
| gpu | energy-first | -4.9% (better) | -2.7% (better) | 8.2 / 4.4 / 23.8 | 0.0 |

| gpu | park | -4.9% (better) | -2.7% (better) | 0.0 / 4.4 / 23.8 | 14.4 |
| gpu_always_on | energy-first | -4.7% (better) | -3.2% (better) | 0.0 / 0.0 / 0.0 | 14.4 |
| gpu_always_on | balanced | -4.7% (better) | -3.2% (better) | 0.0 / 0.0 / 0.0 | 10.9 |
| gpu_always_on | wear-first | -4.2% (better) | -2.8% (better) | 0.0 / 0.0 / 0.0 | 8.0 |
| gpu_always_on | park | -4.7% (better) | -3.2% (better) | 0.0 / 0.0 / 0.0 | 14.4 |

Run: `python -m fleet.benchmark --seeds 30 --seed-base 700000 --out out/` (manual Section 8.8).

Throughput mode does not enforce invariant I4 (projected power); its I4 count is included above. The governor issues no page actions by design, so human pages are not reported as a result. All stack results are for a declared synthetic model, not production systems. See `docs/PILOT_PROTOCOL.md` and `docs/CLAIMS_REGISTER.md`.

## Recorded workloads (PlanetLab)

The frozen laws, without retuning, on recorded utilization shapes from 9 PlanetLab/CoMon VM CPU traces, with a declared scale mapping, governor as node-pool authority in place of the Cluster Autoscaler (30 scenarios; `fleet/traces/`, SHA-256 registered). Observe identical in 30/30.

| Arm | Energy vs HPA 0.7 + CA | vs Karpenter-lite | Time healthy | Node reversals |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| k8s_hpa70_karpenter | -24.2% | +0.0% | 100.00% | 1.93 |
| omni_fleet | -40.6% | -21.7% | 99.92% | 2.03 |
| omni_fleet_balanced | -37.5% | -17.5% | 99.92% | 1.87 |
| omni_fleet_wear | -31.0% | -8.9% | 99.92% | 1.57 |
| omni_fleet_park | +1.3% | +33.6% | 99.92% | 0.00 |

Energy differences of the energy-first, balanced and wear-first settings are significant against both baselines; time healthy and work completed are significantly lower by 0.08 points and 0.01%.

## Savings projection

`python benchmarks/savings.py` (C++: `oc_savings`) applies the measured energy reduction relative to HPA + Karpenter-lite to declared fleet profiles and writes `results/SAVINGS.csv`: annual MWh, USD and t CO2, with low / high bounds from the paired 95% intervals. It is a projection from simulation, not measured savings. Edit `PROFILES` in `benchmarks/savings.py` for your own fleet and prices.

## Running Omni-Compass on your cluster

`omni_controller/` is the live controller. It has been tested against a fake kubectl only; run it observe-first.

```
# 1. observe only (read-only permissions): decisions logged, nothing written
kubectl apply -f deploy/rbac-observe.yaml
python -m omni_controller.controller --mode observe --interval 60 --audit audit.jsonl
# 2. write HPA targets (after reviewing the observe log); try --dry-run first
kubectl apply -f deploy/rbac-target.yaml
python -m omni_controller.controller --mode target --dry-run
python -m omni_controller.controller --mode target
# 3. size one node pool the Cluster Autoscaler does not manage (example: AWS Auto Scaling group)
python -m omni_controller.controller --mode nodepool --min-nodes 3 --max-nodes 40 \
  --node-scale-cmd "aws autoscaling set-desired-capacity --auto-scaling-group-name POOL --desired-capacity {n}"
# kill switch: restores every HPA target Omni changed, returns to observe
touch /tmp/omni.kill
```
In-cluster: `docker build -f deploy/Dockerfile -t omni-compass:local .` then `kubectl apply -f deploy/controller.yaml`.

## Running on real data

No real capture or recorded trace has been run inside this package (no cluster, no network access here). The paths are tested on inputs in the exact real formats:

```
# 1. capture a live cluster (read-only; kubectl + jq)
OUT=capture.csv INTERVAL=15 DURATION=21600 bash fleet/capture/kube_capture.sh
# 2. what Omni-Compass would have recommended (observe only; counterfactual)
python fleet/capture_replay.py capture.csv --idle-w 200 --dyn-w 350 --out replay/
# 3. every fleet arm on recorded PlanetLab workloads
python -m fleet.planetlab --dir fleet/traces/planetlab --scenarios 30 --out planetlab_out/
```
