Redis as shipped with the operator's ceiling (64 MB, allkeys-lru) is native; omni is the compass law on the ceiling through Redis's own console inside [16, 512] MB, holding the application's own request latency at 40% of the 2 ms line (a hit is inside, a miss and its 5 ms store trip outside). The same requests in both arms. Memory held is the resource; the host's CPU seconds include the compass's own cost. Every row is reported, losses included.

## burst: 8192 B values, working set 2,500 keys × notch, steps 1 6 1 8 1 6 × 30.0 s

Redis 7.0.15; 1500 requests a second offered; 3 paired repetitions; engine omni-v10 (digest 4bf39b0d707784de, 47 files) at `f09db2756842`.

| Gauge | native | omni | change | 95% interval of the difference | reading |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| work inside the response line (requests a second answered within the line) | 1,076 | 1,076 | +0.0% | -0.16 to 0.241 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| throughput (requests a second) | 1,500 | 1,500 | +0.0% | -0.0317 to 0.0642 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| cache hit rate | 0.718 | 0.718 | -0.0% | -0.00023 to 0.000223 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, 95th percentile (ms) | 5.75 | 5.75 | -0.0% | -0.0188 to 0.0166 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, 99th percentile (ms) | 5.81 | 5.82 | +0.2% | -0.0161 to 0.0335 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, mean (ms) | 1.75 | 1.75 | +0.0% | -0.00801 to 0.00955 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| failed requests | 0 | 0 |  | 0 to 0 | EVEN, the same |
| memory ceiling held, mean (MB; the knob, the resource) | 64 | 62.4 | -2.5% | -1.71 to -1.49 | GAIN |
| memory used, mean (MB) | 57.2 | 56.5 | -1.2% | -0.74 to -0.582 | GAIN |
| keys evicted | 71,778 | 71,793 | +0.0% | -15.1 to 45.1 | shown, not judged |
| host CPU busy (share of the run) | 0.139 | 0.131 | -5.8% | -0.0727 to 0.0567 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds | 93.1 | 86.9 | -6.7% | -56.9 to 44.5 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds per 1,000 requests inside the line | 0.481 | 0.449 | -6.7% | -0.294 to 0.23 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| ceiling changes written (the knob's moves) | 0 | 6 |  | 6 to 6 | shown, not judged |

Every omni arm handed back to native's ceiling (64 MB): yes; another writer seen: no; fail-ups: 6.
