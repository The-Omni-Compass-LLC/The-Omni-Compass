Redis exactly as shipped, with no memory ceiling and noeviction, is native; with no ceiling the knob is at its limit on native, so omni reads and writes nothing, and every gauge is native's. Otherwise omni is the compass law on the ceiling through Redis's own console inside [16, 512] MB, holding the application's own request latency at 40% of the 2 ms line (a hit is inside, a miss and its 5 ms store trip outside). The same requests in both arms. Memory held is the resource; the host's CPU seconds include the compass's own cost. Every row is reported, losses included.

## large: 32768 B values, working set 625 keys × notch, steps 1 2 3 2 3 4 5 6 5 4 3 2 1 2 1 × 30.0 s

Redis 7.0.15; 1500 requests a second offered; 3 paired repetitions; engine omni-v16 (digest 5c5502f12b1c0ce4, 55 files) at `d27db5f66c71`.

| Gauge | native | omni | change | 95% interval of the difference | reading |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| work inside the response line (requests a second answered within the line) | 1,472 | 1,472 | -0.0% | -0.376 to 0.25 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| throughput (requests a second) | 1,500 | 1,500 | +0.0% | -0.00284 to 0.00322 | EVEN, the same |
| cache hit rate | 0.981 | 0.981 | +0.0% | 0 to 0 | EVEN, the same |
| latency, 95th percentile (ms) | 0.23 | 0.234 | +1.7% | -0.0079 to 0.0155 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, 99th percentile (ms) | 5.72 | 5.72 | -0.0% | -0.0113 to 0.00738 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, mean (ms) | 0.288 | 0.288 | +0.1% | -0.00411 to 0.00449 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| failed requests | 0 | 0 |  | 0 to 0 | EVEN, the same |
| memory ceiling held, mean (MB; the knob, the resource) | 0 | 0 |  | 0 to 0 | EVEN, the same |
| memory used, mean (MB) | 348 | 348 | +0.0% | -0.00926 to 0.0582 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| keys evicted | 0 | 0 |  | 0 to 0 | shown, not judged |
| host CPU busy (share of the run) | 0.0934 | 0.0797 | -14.7% | -0.0685 to 0.041 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds | 157 | 132 | -16.2% | -126 to 74.6 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds per 1,000 requests inside the line | 0.237 | 0.199 | -16.2% | -0.19 to 0.113 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| ceiling changes written (the knob's moves) | 0 | 0 |  | 0 to 0 | shown, not judged |

Every omni arm handed back to native's ceiling (none MB): yes; another writer seen: no; fail-ups: 0.
