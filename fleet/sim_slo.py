"""Fleet simulation with a response-time gauge and a response-time nerve (speed-first mode).

fleet/sim.py is frozen by results/fleet/PREREGISTRATION.json and has no response-time gauge: its scoring checks that
work finishes and backlog stays small, but never how long a request waits. This module runs the same plant, the same
HPA, Cluster Autoscaler and Karpenter-lite, the same boot delay and power model, and adds:

  response time   per workload and tick, R = S + Wq + W_backlog, where
                  S = S0 / cap                        service time (a power cap slows the CPU)
                  Wq = S * u^(sqrt(2(c+1)) - 1) / (c (1 - u))   queueing delay, Sakasegawa's M/M/c approximation,
                                                      c = scheduled pods, u = demand / scheduled capacity (<= 0.99)
                  W_backlog = backlog / capacity * TICK      time to drain work already waiting
                  S0 = 100 ms. Gauges: demand-weighted p95, p99 and mean over every (tick, workload).
                  Job vessels (batch, gpu) have no request queue: R = S + W_backlog (job wait).
  latency nerve   (omni arms, when lat_gain > 0) the governor's queue observation becomes
                  max(queue, lat_gain * max(0, R_recent / (slo_mult * S0) - 1)), R_recent = worst demand-weighted
                  response time over the ticks since the last decision. The engine equations are unchanged.

Arm names and behaviour are those of fleet/sim.py; k8s_hpa50_ca (HPA target 0.5) is added because 50% is the
target of the live lab workload. With lat_gain = 0 and the frozen fleet law, omni_fleet here reproduces the
frozen omni_fleet trace (checked by tests/test_sim_slo.py).
