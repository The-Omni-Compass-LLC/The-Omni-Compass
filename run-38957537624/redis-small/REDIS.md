Redis as shipped with the operator's ceiling (64 MB, allkeys-lru) is native; omni is the compass law on the ceiling through Redis's own console inside [16, 512] MB, holding the application's own request latency at 40% of the 2 ms line (a hit is inside, a miss and its 5 ms store trip outside). The same requests in both arms. Memory held is the resource; the host's CPU seconds include the compass's own cost. Every row is reported, losses included.

## small: 2048 B values, working set 10,000 keys × notch, steps 1 2 3 2 3 4 5 6 5 4 3 2 1 2 1 × 30.0 s

Redis 7.0.15; 1500 requests a second offered; 3 paired repetitions; engine omni-v7 (digest d6d467b824c585f1, 46 files) at `cf8dccec0604`.

| Gauge | native | omni | change | 95% interval of the difference | reading |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| work inside the response line (requests a second answered within the line) | 924 | 936 | +1.3% | 7.34 to 16.9 | GAIN |
| throughput (requests a second) | 1,500 | 1,500 | -0.0% | -0.0767 to 0.062 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| cache hit rate | 0.617 | 0.625 | +1.3% | 0.00623 to 0.0095 | GAIN |
| latency, 95th percentile (ms) | 5.65 | 5.64 | -0.1% | -0.0867 to 0.0745 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, 99th percentile (ms) | 6.26 | 6.26 | +0.0% | -1.93 to 1.94 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, mean (ms) | 2.26 | 2.2 | -2.3% | -0.156 to 0.0538 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| failed requests | 0 | 0 |  | 0 to 0 | EVEN, the same |
| memory ceiling held, mean (MB; the knob, the resource) | 64 | 65.4 | +2.2% | 0.988 to 1.88 | power given |
| memory used, mean (MB) | 60.7 | 61.8 | +1.8% | 0.891 to 1.24 | power given |
| keys evicted | 243,199 | 240,030 | -1.3% | -6,568 to 230 | shown, not judged |
| host CPU busy (share of the run) | 0.137 | 0.134 | -1.9% | -0.0219 to 0.0167 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds | 240 | 236 | -1.8% | -43.3 to 34.5 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds per 1,000 requests inside the line | 0.577 | 0.56 | -3.1% | -0.111 to 0.0751 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| ceiling changes written (the knob's moves) | 0 | 15.3 |  | 7.74 to 22.9 | shown, not judged |

Every omni arm handed back to the operator's ceiling: yes; another writer seen: no; fail-ups: 15.
