MongoDB as shipped with the operator's WiredTiger cache (512 MB) is native; omni is the compass law on the cache size through the server's own console inside [256, 2048] MB, holding the server's own read latency at 40% of the 1 ms line. YCSB's published core workloads, the same operations in both arms, the key space stepping through the cache and past it. Memory held is the resource; the host's CPU seconds include the compass's own cost. Every row is reported, losses included.

## tuning: YCSB workloada, 250,000 records × notch, steps 1 2 3 2 3 4 5 6 5 4 3 2 1 2 1 × 30.0 s (the tuning workload)

MongoDB 8.0.34, YCSB 0.17.0; 3,000 operations a second offered from 32 threads; 3 paired repetitions; engine omni-v16 (digest 5c5502f12b1c0ce4, 55 files) at `464fb9e27535`.

| Gauge | native | omni | change | 95% interval of the difference | reading |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| work inside the response line (operations a second answered within the line) | 2,933 | 2,933 | -0.0% | -1.74 to 1.57 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| throughput (operations a second) | 2,938 | 2,938 | -0.0% | -1.53 to 1.44 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, 95th percentile (ms) | 0.148 | 0.151 | +2.3% | -0.011 to 0.0177 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, 99th percentile (ms) | 0.366 | 0.37 | +1.2% | -0.0242 to 0.0329 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, mean (ms) | 0.0805 | 0.0806 | +0.2% | -0.000381 to 0.00073 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| failed operations | 0 | 0 |  | 0 to 0 | EVEN, the same |
| cache size held, mean (MB; the knob, the resource) | 512 | 507 | -1.0% | -7.97 to -2.04 | GAIN |
| bytes in the cache, mean (MB) | 419 | 417 | -0.5% | -6.86 to 2.71 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| pages read into the cache (misses) | 683,237 | 691,698 | +1.2% | 3,107 to 13,816 | shown, not judged |
| host CPU busy (share of the run) | 0.108 | 0.124 | +14.2% | -0.0773 to 0.108 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds | 194 | 226 | +16.8% | -160 to 225 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds per 1,000 operations inside the line | 0.145 | 0.169 | +16.7% | -0.119 to 0.168 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| cache size changes written (the knob's moves) | 0 | 4 |  | 4 to 4 | shown, not judged |

Every omni arm handed back to the operator's cache size: yes; another writer seen: no; fail-ups: 0.
