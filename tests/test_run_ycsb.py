notches only while it is full and missing, calm with the cache's misses under 1% of its requests gives back one notch after the
dwell and never in a second with no request, the wall adds a quarter of the cover, the cover holds), the plug's one-writer rule
against a fake server console, the server's own reading from serverStatus,
YCSB's raw records and failed-operation summary parsed, and the paired reading over repetitions."""
