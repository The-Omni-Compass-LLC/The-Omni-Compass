"""Two-way nervous system (manuscript Appendix J: the nervous system owns sensing integrity, delay and dropout handling,
and feedback interpretation).
W1 afferent integrity: a blind sense (stale > 0) never grants any organ contraction and never admits held batch work,
   over random engine states; capacity expansion is untouched (the safe direction), and pausing batch (its protective
   contraction) stays allowed
W2 the latency sense is judged against the wall clock: a frozen probe file is blind even if its last window was clean
   (a hung probe must never be read as the present); a window with no successful request is blind; a fresh clean window is live
W3 failed requests in a live window become latency pressure (a failure is never read as silence)
W4 efferent feedback: the node gate refuses a new release while a sense is blind or the last node command did not land"""
