"""The compass, computed, against its own face and its own equations.
C1 the eight points sit where the face puts them: + at Α (0 deg), ⇄ at Δ (45), > at Β (90), ⊤ at Λ (135), − at Ω (180),
   ≈ at Π (225), < at Γ (270), ✦ at Ψ (315); the 24 rim letters are 15 degrees apart, clockwise from Α.
C2 the axle's rest point S* solves equation (6): delta - alpha_s S - (3/4) beta_s S^2 = 0.
C3 one turn of the wheel closes one circle: I -> II -> III -> IV -> I, counted at ignition (IV -> I).
C4 G . n <= 0 on the boundary of Omega: at the ceiling nothing moves up, at the floor nothing moves down; inside, anything.
C5 the ledger L = e^2/2 + Phi(S) - Phi(S*) descends along an unforced return to rest."""
