"""The compass law in the live Kubernetes controller (--law compass), against the fake kubectl (tests/fake_cluster/kubectl).

  calm      p95 far under the SLO: the compass pulls down, the HPA target never rises above the operator's (never tighter
            than native), and the node pool gives one machine back per decision through the release gate
  hot       p95 past the 0.95 wall: fail up, the HPA target goes to the bottom of its cover (60% of the operator's) at
            once and the node pool asks for one machine more
  blind     no live probe samples: read as past the wall, same as hot
  demand    calm again while the demand still grows: the extra pods stay; the operator's target returns once the
            demand has stopped growing for one autoscaler window (no remove-then-restart)
  steady    a raise of the target (fewer pods) waits for a demand steady for one autoscaler window
  room      the replica cap raised only while it binds and the line is threatened, up to the operator's ceiling;
            returned when calm and steady; the reset restores it
  sensed    two services, the probe measuring one: only its HPA moves; the neighbour's stays the operator's
  restore   the reset returns every HPA target to the operator's and removes every record
  engine    the six-state engine still runs every decision (E and U in the audit) and the decision names the compass law
