"""The verdict (omnicompass/verdict.py): Omni-Compass moves a knob only where it measures that the muscle is no worse.

  native     a muscle that is slower at every step down is left native: every trial refused, nothing allowed
  free       a muscle that costs nothing at the first steps: those steps are allowed, and the first step that costs more
             than the allowance is refused
  calm       a trial under stress is abandoned at once and the knob goes back
  recheck    a refused step is not tried again before its recheck time, and is tried again after it
  stepwise   incremental steps are held to the cost first measured at native, so they cannot add up past the allowance
  card       on the modelled card, compute-bound work: Omni on top of the firmware never makes a request more than the
             allowance slower than the firmware alone
