"""The compass on a realm muscle keeps its state from one decision to the next (realms/compass_arm.py).

Each muscle's compass is made once, on its first decision, and then carries its position, its velocity and the knob's
continuous value forward. A compass made fresh every decision would forget the knob between decisions, so the knob could
never travel more than one step from native. A renamed attribute did exactly that (2026-10-05); this test keeps it from
coming back."""
