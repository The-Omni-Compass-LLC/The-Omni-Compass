"""CPU and GPU on one conserved power budget (hardware/node_exchange.py), checked on every card fit and two budgets.
N1 the budget is conserved: the joint conveyance (XC) never draws the site over its budget
N2 holding the CPUs is what makes the hand-over safe: counting only the CPUs' last measured draw (XM) does go over
N3 against today's practice (S: every GPU at one fixed cap that fits the CPUs' maximum) XC serves at least as much work
   and leaves less backlog
N4 the CPU clock read from an allocation never exceeds that allocation's power at the load it serves"""
