"""Three-way HPA agreement: fleet harness HPA, independent C++ HPA (test_cpp_hpa_parity), and an externally written
independent Python HPA (tests/third_party/hpa_independent.py).

The external implementation keeps recommendations with t >= cutoff (inclusive). Upstream Kubernetes keeps
recommendations whose timestamp is After(cutoff) (exclusive). At a fixed 15 s cadence the harness's 20-sample ring
is exactly the exclusive window (now - 300 s, now]. The test measures the inclusive disagreement and requires exact
agreement once the external window is made exclusive.
