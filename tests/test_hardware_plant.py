"""Hardware plant integrity (adopted from the Grok review's referee gate, extended).
H1 on a GPU the arms must not collapse: B (vendor keeps TDP, Omni caps) and C (Omni sizes) give different settings
H2 C sizes by the device law: setting = min(engine cap, (want / rho)^(1/gamma)), gamma = 1 for CPU clocks
H3 C does the same work as native (within 0.1%) and never more heat-over minutes than native, on every vessel"""
