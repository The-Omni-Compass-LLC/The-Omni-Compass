"""The two-wire GPU governor (omni_controller/gpu_compass.py) against the stand-in nvidia-smi (tests/fake_gpu/nvidia-smi),
on a card its own power limit holds at 900 MHz while busy (top clock 1695 MHz), with calm response times:

  learn     until the card's own busy clock and draw are learned, neither wire moves below where the card is
  floor     after that, the clock ceiling never goes under the card's own busy clock, so waiting work is never served
            slower than native; the lid never goes under the card's own busy draw plus headroom
  race      a saturated card (work waiting) runs at full speed, ceiling at the top and the lid at the start; it is not a
            fail-up, and it is where the card's own level is learned
  pace      at partial load with calm response times the compass lowers the ceiling, never under the learned busy clock
  hot       response times past the line: fail up, ceiling to the top and the lid to the start limit
  restore   clocks reset and the start limit back at the end
