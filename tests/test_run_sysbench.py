"""The sysbench-on-MySQL runner (tools/run_sysbench.py) without a server or sysbench: the decision rule (slow statements grow the

chunks, the cover holds), the plug's one-writer rule and its wait for the server's online resize against a fake console, the
server's own reading from the performance schema, sysbench's histogram and summary parsed, quantiles from the histogram, and the
