"""The robustness test's readings (tools/live_reps.py, docs/ROBUSTNESS_PREREGISTRATION.md) without a cluster: the kill and
hand-back marks are read from robust.log, the 120 s after the kill are compared in both arms from the probe's own records,
the governor's memory ratio comes from the process-table samples, a hand-back past the allowance or a memory growth past
the limit reads WORSE, and the three-run rows read confirmed only when every run's every repetition was handed back."""
