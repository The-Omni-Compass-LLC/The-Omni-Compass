Apache Kafka as shipped (one broker, a topic of 8 partitions); native: the consumer group at the operator's count (2); omni: the compass law on the consumer count inside [1, 8], holding the group's own end-to-end latency at 40% of the 500 ms line. The same offered load in both arms. Energy is the host's CPU seconds, the compass's own cost included. Every row is reported, losses included.

## tuning: 2.0 ms of work a message, 256 B, steps 1 2 3 2 3 4 5 6 5 4 3 2 1 2 1 × 30.0 s (the tuning workload)

Native capacity 974 messages a second; base rate 146.1/s; 3 paired repetitions; engine omni-v12 (digest d38b58fbe28939b8, 47 files) at `6f4be24ffb43`.

| Gauge | native | omni | change | 95% interval of the difference | reading |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| work inside the response line (messages a second handled within the line) | 366 | 366 | -0.0% | -1.28 to 1.15 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| throughput (messages a second consumed) | 429 | 429 | -0.0% | -0.0219 to 0.00778 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| end-to-end latency, 95th percentile (ms) | 2,350 | 2,307 | -1.8% | -70.4 to -15 | GAIN |
| end-to-end latency, 99th percentile (ms) | 3,651 | 3,707 | +1.6% | -524 to 638 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| end-to-end latency, median (ms) | 8.56 | 8.54 | -0.3% | -0.0565 to 0.0125 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| end-to-end latency, mean (ms) | 317 | 311 | -1.6% | -20.6 to 10.3 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| consumer lag, most messages waiting at once | 1,661 | 1,676 | +0.9% | -79.8 to 110 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| consumer lag, mean messages waiting | 140 | 138 | -1.7% | -7.94 to 3.16 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| messages produced and never consumed | 0 | 0 |  | 0 to 0 | EVEN, the same |
| consumers running, mean (the resources held) | 2 | 1.99 | -0.3% | -0.00665 to -0.00665 | GAIN |
| consumers running, most at once | 2 | 2 | +0.0% | 0 to 0 | EVEN, the same |
| host CPU busy (share of the run) | 0.309 | 0.307 | -0.6% | -0.0109 to 0.00694 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds | 537 | 533 | -0.6% | -18.5 to 11.6 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds per 1,000 messages inside the line | 3.26 | 3.24 | -0.6% | -0.121 to 0.0799 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| consumer changes written (the knob's moves) | 2 | 4 | +100.0% | 2 to 2 | shown, not judged |

Every omni arm handed back to the operator's count: yes; fail-ups: 3.
