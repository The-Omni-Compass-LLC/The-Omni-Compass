MongoDB exactly as shipped, its WiredTiger cache at the server's own default (7482 MB on this machine), is native; a cache above the cover is at its limit on native, and omni then reads and writes nothing. Otherwise omni is the compass law on the cache size through the server's own console inside [256, 2048] MB, holding the server's own read latency at 40% of the 1 ms line. YCSB's published core workloads, the same operations in both arms, the key space stepping through the cache and past it. Memory held is the resource; the host's CPU seconds include the compass's own cost. Every row is reported, losses included.

MongoDB 8.0.34, YCSB 0.17.0; 3,000 operations a second offered from 32 threads; 3 paired repetitions; engine omni-v16 (digest 5c5502f12b1c0ce4, 55 files) at `d27db5f66c71`.

| Gauge | native | omni | change | 95% interval of the difference | reading |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| work inside the response line (operations a second answered within the line) | 2,940 | 2,939 | -0.0% | -3.03 to 2.23 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| throughput (operations a second) | 2,942 | 2,941 | -0.0% | -2.47 to 1.77 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, 95th percentile (ms) | 0.131 | 0.132 | +0.8% | -0.0454 to 0.0474 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, 99th percentile (ms) | 0.337 | 0.333 | -1.1% | -0.0471 to 0.0397 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, mean (ms) | 0.0607 | 0.0603 | -0.6% | -0.00712 to 0.0064 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| failed operations | 0 | 0 |  | 0 to 0 | EVEN, the same |
| cache size held, mean (MB; the knob, the resource) | 7,482 | 7,482 | +0.0% | 0 to 0 | EVEN, the same |
| bytes in the cache, mean (MB) | 1,367 | 1,366 | -0.1% | -4.44 to 2.32 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| pages read into the cache (misses) | 61,827 | 61,842 | +0.0% | -341 to 372 | shown, not judged |
| host CPU busy (share of the run) | 0.0883 | 0.0738 | -16.4% | -0.0726 to 0.0436 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds | 162 | 133 | -18.2% | -149 to 89.9 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds per 1,000 operations inside the line | 0.121 | 0.099 | -18.2% | -0.111 to 0.0671 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| cache size changes written (the knob's moves) | 0 | 0 |  | 0 to 0 | shown, not judged |

Every omni arm handed back to the operator's cache size: yes; another writer seen: no; fail-ups: 0.
