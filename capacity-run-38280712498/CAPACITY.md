Evidence class **L** (the real thing: a real Kubernetes cluster, real requests, every answer counted). The cap is a quota on the served app's CPU (the same in both arms, enforced by the cluster, not by either controller); the load rises step by step past what the cap can serve, the same requests in both arms. **Completed work**: requests answered within the response-time line over the whole window. **Capacity**: the highest offered rate served while at least 95% of a step's requests are answered within the line and no more than 1% fail or are never sent. Paired within one job (both arms on one runner, order rotated).

| Cap (cores) | Pairs | Offered (requests) | Completed, native | Completed, Omni on top | Difference | Reading | Capacity, native → Omni (req/s) | Capacity reading | p95, native → Omni (ms) | Failed or not sent, native → Omni |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2 | 1 | 32,998 | 2,870 | 2,908 | +1.3% | **one pair (no reading)** | 5.0 → 5.0 | one pair (no reading) | 536 → 694 | 89.2% → 88.9% |

**The audit lines** (one per row, in plain words):

- At 2 cores, the difference in completed work (+1.3%; 1 pair, no interval) is inside the noise: no difference beyond the noise at this cap. The highest load served within both limits: 5.0 → 5.0 requests a second (one pair (no reading)). Failed or never sent: 89.2% → 88.9%.

## How to read a row

- **Both arms served everything offered** (the cap never reached): the row shows speed, not more work. A run with a fixed offered load, served in full by both arms, can only show faster service for that load (the KEDA add-on run of 12 October: CPU used +32%, 95th-percentile response -55%, the same six workers; faster service for the same work, not yet more completed work).
- **The cap holds native back** (native leaves offered requests unanswered within the line): a higher count for Omni on top at the same cap is more work from the same capacity.
- **Each step up in the cap**: if both arms do more as the cap rises, the step table shows which turns each added core into more completed work.
- A loss is reported as it stands; its cause is looked for in our own wiring, setup and scoring first.
