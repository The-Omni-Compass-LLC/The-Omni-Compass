Redis as shipped with the operator's ceiling (64 MB, allkeys-lru) is native; omni is the compass law on the ceiling through Redis's own console inside [16, 512] MB, holding the application's own request latency at 40% of the 2 ms line (a hit is inside, a miss and its 5 ms store trip outside). The same requests in both arms. Memory held is the resource; the host's CPU seconds include the compass's own cost. Every row is reported, losses included.

## tuning: 8192 B values, working set 2,500 keys × notch, steps 1 2 3 2 3 4 5 6 5 4 3 2 1 2 1 × 30.0 s (the tuning workload)

Redis 7.0.15; 1500 requests a second offered; 3 paired repetitions; engine omni-v13 (digest 0088837333c6f0fc, 47 files) at `e85212fa7d01`.

| Gauge | native | omni | change | 95% interval of the difference | reading |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| work inside the response line (requests a second answered within the line) | 1,184 | 1,194 | +0.8% | 1.06 to 18.8 | GAIN |
| throughput (requests a second) | 1,500 | 1,500 | -0.0% | -0.007 to 0.00324 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| cache hit rate | 0.789 | 0.796 | +0.8% | 0.000699 to 0.0125 | GAIN |
| latency, 95th percentile (ms) | 5.74 | 5.74 | +0.0% | -0.0145 to 0.0152 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, 99th percentile (ms) | 5.8 | 5.8 | +0.1% | -0.0116 to 0.0226 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, mean (ms) | 1.35 | 1.31 | -2.5% | -0.0738 to 0.00745 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| failed requests | 0 | 0 |  | 0 to 0 | EVEN, the same |
| memory ceiling held, mean (MB; the knob, the resource) | 64 | 65.1 | +1.7% | -0.529 to 2.75 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| memory used, mean (MB) | 61.2 | 62 | +1.4% | -0.181 to 1.88 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| keys evicted | 138,237 | 134,612 | -2.6% | -7,611 to 359 | shown, not judged |
| host CPU busy (share of the run) | 0.124 | 0.118 | -4.4% | -0.0845 to 0.0735 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds | 208 | 198 | -4.9% | -159 to 138 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds per 1,000 requests inside the line | 0.39 | 0.368 | -5.7% | -0.302 to 0.258 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| ceiling changes written (the knob's moves) | 0 | 18.3 |  | 7.99 to 28.7 | shown, not judged |

Every omni arm handed back to native's ceiling (64 MB): yes; another writer seen: no; fail-ups: 20.
