"""Problem map 5: cold starts / scale-from-zero latency (knative/serving #4902, #14202; KEDA http-add-on #219).

Plant (one scale-to-zero service, 1-second steps, 4 hours)
  arrivals A(t) req/s: idle gaps, recurring bursts (jittered, cron-like) and random sessions; service time 0.2 s;
  an instance serves K = 10 concurrent requests (50 req/s); cold start D seconds (seed: 2-10 s, image + runtime)
  requests beyond warm capacity queue; while no instance is warm they wait for the first one to boot
Arms
  native_knative   Knative KPA defaults: target concurrency K, stable window 60 s, panic window 6 s at 200%,
                   scale to zero after 60 s without traffic + 30 s grace
  native_keda      KEDA HTTP add-on defaults: polling every 30 s, cooldown 300 s before scale to zero
  omni             desired = ceil(concurrency / (K rho*)) on max(6 s, 60 s) averages, rho* from the engine; the engine
                   evolves on queue, load and the arrival trend (drift); keep-alive before scale to zero grows with
                   the engine's integrated need I_U (services that burst again are kept warm longer); one instance
                   pre-warmed when the rate trend is rising from idle
  omni_no_engine   same mapping, engine not evolved
