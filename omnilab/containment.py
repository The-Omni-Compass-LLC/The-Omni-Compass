"""Problem map 13: runaway AI agents (loops, recursive spawning, overnight five-figure bills; Dark Reading).

Plant (1-minute steps, 24 hours; 40 agents)
  every agent does work: tool/model calls that cost money, sub-agent spawns, outbound calls; honest agents have
  their own rhythm and legitimate bursts (a big task can run at 3-6x its usual rate for 10-60 minutes)
  rogue onsets (random agent, random time):
    loop        spend rate jumps 10-40x (retry / self-call loop)
    fork        spawns sub-agents that each spend and spawn (doubling)
    exfil       calls to non-allow-listed destinations
    escalate    attempts at forbidden APIs (secrets, cluster-admin)
  enforcement layers common to every arm: RBAC denies forbidden APIs and a NetworkPolicy blocks non-allow-listed
  egress (both blocked at the source); attempts are still observable
Arms
  native_static    per-agent daily budget cap ($150) and a quota of 20 sub-agents: stops an agent when a cap is hit
  native_tight     the same with caps sized to stop runaways early ($40, 5 sub-agents): the operator's other choice
  omni             one engine per agent; observes spend rate against the agent's own baseline (queue), spawn rate
                   (load), denied attempts (security_block), rate change (drift); actions: throttle (halve the
                   agent's rate) when the engine's integrated need I_U or E rises; contain (freeze + revoke + audit)
                   when a denied attempt is seen or pressure persists past the dwell; release throttle when calm
  omni_no_engine   same mapping, engine not evolved
Gauges: rogue overspend ($ spent by rogue agents after onset), time to contain (minutes), peak sub-agents, honest
agents stopped (false stops), honest work completed (%), forbidden actions executed (always 0: RBAC), audit lines.
