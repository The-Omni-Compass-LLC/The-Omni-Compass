Redis exactly as shipped, with no memory ceiling and noeviction, is native; with no ceiling the knob is at its limit on native, so omni reads and writes nothing, and every gauge is native's. Otherwise omni is the compass law on the ceiling through Redis's own console inside [16, 512] MB, holding the application's own request latency at 40% of the 2 ms line (a hit is inside, a miss and its 5 ms store trip outside). The same requests in both arms. Memory held is the resource; the host's CPU seconds include the compass's own cost. Every row is reported, losses included.

## large: 32768 B values, working set 625 keys × notch, steps 1 2 3 2 3 4 5 6 5 4 3 2 1 2 1 × 30.0 s

Redis 7.0.15; 1500 requests a second offered; 3 paired repetitions; engine omni-v17 (digest 7c937d09e4031cc7, 55 files) at `6fcdf41aad34`.

| Gauge | native | omni | change | 95% interval of the difference | reading |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| work inside the response line (requests a second answered within the line) | 1,472 | 1,472 | -0.0% | -0.693 to 0.473 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| throughput (requests a second) | 1,500 | 1,500 | +0.0% | -0.00119 to 0.00164 | EVEN, the same |
| cache hit rate | 0.981 | 0.981 | +0.0% | -1.14e-06 to 3.11e-06 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, 95th percentile (ms) | 0.23 | 0.231 | +0.6% | -0.00649 to 0.00913 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, 99th percentile (ms) | 5.72 | 5.72 | +0.0% | -0.0132 to 0.0173 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, mean (ms) | 0.288 | 0.288 | +0.1% | -0.00445 to 0.00498 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| failed requests | 0 | 0 |  | 0 to 0 | EVEN, the same |
| memory ceiling held, mean (MB; the knob, the resource) | 0 | 0 |  | 0 to 0 | EVEN, the same |
| memory used, mean (MB) | 348 | 349 | +0.0% | 0.0303 to 0.0349 | power given |
| keys evicted | 0 | 0 |  | 0 to 0 | shown, not judged |
| host CPU busy (share of the run) | 0.0841 | 0.0956 | +13.7% | -0.0311 to 0.0541 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds | 140 | 161 | +15.1% | -57.5 to 99.7 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds per 1,000 requests inside the line | 0.211 | 0.243 | +15.1% | -0.0869 to 0.151 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| ceiling changes written (the knob's moves) | 0 | 0 |  | 0 to 0 | shown, not judged |

Every omni arm handed back to native's ceiling (none MB): yes; another writer seen: no; fail-ups: 0.
