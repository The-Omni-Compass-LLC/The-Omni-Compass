Omni-Compass uses the following third-party components. Each remains under its own license; nothing in the

| NumPy | numerical arrays | BSD-3-Clause |
| Matplotlib | charts in the reports | Matplotlib License (PSF-based, BSD-compatible) |
| ReportLab (open-source edition) | the printable book and reports | BSD-3-Clause |
| Numba | compiled inner loops of the motion-axis plant | BSD-2-Clause |
| PyTorch (on GPU machines only, not installed by `requirements.txt`) | the GPU workload of the benchmark | BSD-3-Clause |
| `tests/third_party/hpa_independent.py` | an independently written HPA reference used unmodified in tests | its own terms, stated in the file |
| Liberation Serif and Liberation Sans fonts (embedded in the PDF book) | typesetting | SIL Open Font License 1.1 |

| PlanetLab / CoMon VM CPU traces, March 2011 (`fleet/traces/`, `k8s_controlplane/traces/`; source in their `PROVENANCE.json`) | held-out demand for the modelled fleet | their own terms (public research data); no Omni-Compass copyright is claimed in them |
| Google cluster-usage traces 2011 (`clusterdata-2011-2`), from which `results/traces/google2011/` is derived (`docs/TRACES_PREREGISTRATION.md`) | the public demand trace on the real cluster | Google's published terms for the traces; no Omni-Compass copyright is claimed in the trace itself |

Kubernetes, kind, `kubectl`, the NVIDIA driver and `nvidia-smi` are not distributed with Omni-Compass; it calls them
where an operator has installed them. Their names are the property of their owners (`DISCLOSURES.md`, section 1).
