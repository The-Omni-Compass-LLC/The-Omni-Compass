Native is PostgreSQL as shipped behind PgBouncer's shipped pool of 20 server connections; omni is the same with the compass law writing the pool size through PgBouncer's own console inside [2, 90], handed back at the end. The load is pgbench, rate-limited, stepping one notch at a time, the peak notch offering native's own unlimited capacity. Every row is shown, losses included; a 95% interval of the paired difference (omni minus native) over the repetitions decides whether a change is beyond the noise. There is no watt-meter on the machine: the host's CPU-seconds are measured, no energy is claimed (`docs/POSTGRES_PREREGISTRATION.md`).

## select (-S, scale 20): line 50 ms, 3 paired repetitions

Native capacity, unlimited: 38,790 tps; base rate 5,818 tps; steps [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1] × 30 s; 64 clients. Engine omni-v16 (digest 5c5502f12b1c0ce4, 55 files) at `d27db5f66c71`.

| Gauge | native | omni | change (95% interval) | reading |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| work inside the response line (transactions a second answered within the line) | 17,067 | 17,063 | -0.0% (-0.2 to +0.1) | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| throughput (transactions a second) | 17,067 | 17,063 | -0.0% (-0.2 to +0.1) | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, 95th percentile (ms, lag included) | 0.446 | 0.399 | -10.5% (-36.8 to +15.7) | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, 99th percentile (ms) | 2.94 | 1.76 | -40.1% (-152.4 to +72.3) | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, median (ms) | 0.159 | 0.16 | +0.6% (-2.1 to +3.3) | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, mean (ms) | 0.283 | 0.239 | -15.3% (-68.0 to +37.4) | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| failed transactions | 0 | 0 | +0 (+0 to +0) | EVEN, the same |
| server connections alive, mean (the machines) | 19.8 | 17.1 | -13.4% (-27.8 to +1.0) | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| server connections alive, most at once | 20.0 | 20.0 | +0.0% (+0.0 to +0.0) | EVEN, the same |
| host CPU busy (share of the run) | 0.379 | 0.381 | +0.4% (-2.0 to +2.8) | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds | 644.9 | 647.7 | +0.4% (-1.8 to +2.7) | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds per 1,000 transactions inside the line | 0.084 | 0.0843 | +0.5% (-1.9 to +2.8) | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| the harness's own CPU-seconds (the compass's brain in the omni arm, the sampler in both; inside the host's) | 3.15 | 3.66 | +16.0% (+10.9 to +21.2) | shown, not judged |
| pool size, mean (the knob) | 20.0 | 17.6 | -12.2% (-28.4 to +4.0) | shown, not judged |

The knob handed back and read back at the end of every omni arm: yes; a foreign writer seen: no; Omni's writes per arm: 40, 43, 34; fail-ups per arm: 0, 0, 0.

Per repetition (inside the line tps / p95 ms / servers alive / pool mean):

- rep 1 (native then omni): native 17059 / 0.5 / 20.0 / 20.0; omni 17065 / 0.4 / 16.0 / 16.1
- rep 2 (omni then native): native 17071 / 0.4 / 19.4 / 20.0; omni 17062 / 0.4 / 17.4 / 18.5
- rep 3 (native then omni): native 17073 / 0.4 / 20.0 / 20.0; omni 17063 / 0.4 / 18.0 / 18.1
