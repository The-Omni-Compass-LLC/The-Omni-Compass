"""Omni-Compass on top of a database's operator-set buffer pool: sysbench on MySQL (docs/MYSQL_PREREGISTRATION.md).

MySQL 8.0 as Ubuntu ships it, with the one setting an operator sets once for InnoDB: the buffer pool size, which the server
resizes online in chunks of 128 MB. sysbench's published OLTP workloads ask for rows from a set of tables that widens and
narrows over the run (one notch = one more table of a million rows), so the working set steps through the operator's pool
and past it. The operator's fixed pool is the native controller here.

  native  MySQL at the operator's pool (512 MB) for the whole run
  omni    the same MySQL, with the compass law (omnicompass/compass_law.py) on one knob, the buffer pool size, through the
          server's own console (SET GLOBAL innodb_buffer_pool_size), inside the cover [128 MB, 2,048 MB]: the compass reads the
          server's own mean statement latency over the last second (performance_schema) on a band from 0 to the statement
          line and holds it at 40% of the line; slow statements with the pool full push the pool up a chunk or more (slow
          statements with room to spare are not the pool's to mend), calm with no page read from disk gives a chunk back
          after a dwell; at 95% of the line with the pool full four chunks are added at once (fail up); the pool is handed back
          to the operator's at the end and read back; a size found at a value Omni did not write stops it writing

Gauges from sysbench's own latency histogram and summary (every transaction counted into buckets about 2% wide), the server's
own status (the pool configured, the pages in it, the pages read from disk) and the host's /proc/stat (CPU seconds, the
compass's own cost included). Memory held is the resource; no energy is claimed beyond the host's CPU seconds. Every row is
reported, losses included.
