"""The brain's own verdict on one live knob, in real time (the founder's order of 9 October 2026).

Every knob starts in watch: one wire out, nothing written. It is written only between native and the deepest step a paired
trial on the stack itself has allowed under the declared objective, and a step that fails its trial is not taken. The
trial, the judgement, the allowance and the recheck are the frozen engine's (omnicompass/verdict.py, Omni v3, byte for
byte); this module gives that Verdict the knob's notch, the cost it judges and the condition under which a trial of this
knob is fair. Nothing in the engine changes.

  two directions   spend (more of the resource: a bigger ceiling, more consumers, more connections) and give back (less:
                   fewer connections, a smaller pool or cache), each its own Verdict with its own steps outward from native.
                   Restoring native is never a step: the knob may always be moved back toward the operator's setting.
  the condition    a give-back step is tried while the service is calm and the stack's own give-back condition holds (the
                   engine's rule: a trial is never run under stress); a spend step is tried while the compass asks to spend
                   and the stack's own spend condition holds (a cache full and missing, messages waiting, clients queued),
                   because that is the only time a spend can show what it buys. A give-back trial once started runs on
                   until its samples are in unless the service leaves calm, when it is abandoned (the engine's rule). A
                   spend trial runs to its samples whatever the compass's force: the spend's own effect calms the service
                   within seconds, and a trial ended on that calm could never be judged (the first counted set of 10
                   October 2026 abandoned every Kafka spend trial that way; amendment 3 in the five preregistrations). Only
                   the wall (a fail-up) or the engine's own time limit ends a spend trial early.
  the cost         one sample a second from the stack's own readings. Under the resource objective, the preregistered
                   reading of the Omni index, cost = resource held x host CPU busy share x latency / work: a step passes only
                   if the service gained outweighs the resource and CPU spent, by the index's own arithmetic (a geometric mean
                   of the four ratios no lower than one is the same statement). Under the service objective cost = latency /
                   work: the resources are shown and not judged. Lower is better; "no higher within the tolerance" passes,
                   which is the engine's judge, so a step that buys nothing and costs nothing is allowed and a step that costs
                   more than it buys is refused.
  the hold         during a trial the knob stands at the phase's value whatever the compass asks: the reference at the
                   deepest step already allowed (native at first), then the trial step one notch further. Between trials the
                   compass moves the knob by its own law, clamped to the allowance. A fail-up never spends beyond the
                   allowance; toward native it is always free.
  the record       every trial, allowance, refusal and abandonment is kept for the audit, with the counts and the state:
                   "left native" (no step allowed in either direction) or "acting" with the allowance.
