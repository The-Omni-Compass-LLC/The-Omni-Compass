"""The six organisms' full grid, built from the saved receipts (results/scale/receipts/v3-<size>x.md, each the
printed receipt of one GitHub `six` run): 6 organisms x sizes 1, 10, 100, 1,000 clusters x runs 1, 10, 100, 1,000.

    python3 tools/grid.py        writes results/scale/GRID.md

A cell whose receipt is not saved yet reads "running"; 1,000 runs at 1,000 clusters reads "not run" (about 6,000
machine-hours, beyond the machines available). How to read every table: docs/HOW_TO_READ_THE_RESULTS.md.
