"""The stacked organism: the four realm organisms on one clock, every muscle as often as it appears (1,226 with the
duplicates), native against Omni (docs/REALMS_PREREGISTRATION.md, round 4).

Three arms per seed: native (no governor), separate (one governor per realm), one (one governor over the whole stack).
Checks that the stacked native run equals each realm's own native run, plant by plant. Writes STACK.md, STACK.json,
RUN.json and SHA256SUMS.txt.
