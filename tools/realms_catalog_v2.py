"""Build the Omni v2 catalog (realms/catalog.csv) from three committed sources, by the same rules as v1:

  realms/catalog_v1.csv                 the v1 tower (656 rows), kept byte for byte: every v1 muscle keeps its id, realm,
                                        plant, preset and knob
  docs/realm_study/TRUE_MUSCLES.csv     the realm study's rows marked "added (real, not in the 656)": real controls the
                                        study found in waves 1 to 3 that the tower lacked, each with its system, setting
                                        and source; they join the family the study filed them under (ids 1001 upward)
  realms/wave4_families.csv             wave 4: the thirteen families the tower did not cover (hospitals, clinical
                                        systems, farms, pipelines, rail, ships, ports, mines, district heat, power plants,
                                        renewables and inverters, elevators, pharmaceutical and food plants), each muscle
                                        with its real system, setting and source (ids 2001 upward)

Realm, membership (the spine is in every realm), plant, preset and knob come from tools/realms_catalog.py's FAMILY,
SPINE and knob rules, unchanged. The result is committed as data, so every row can be read and contested; the
provenance (realms/catalog_provenance.json) names the three sources and their digests.

  python3 tools/realms_catalog_v2.py          # rewrite realms/catalog.csv and the provenance; add the wave-4 rows to
                                              # docs/realm_study/TRUE_MUSCLES.csv if they are not there yet
  python3 tools/realms_catalog_v2.py --check  # rebuild in memory and compare with the committed catalog (verify.py)
