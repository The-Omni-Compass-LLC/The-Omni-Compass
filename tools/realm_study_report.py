"""Wave 3 result: the true muscle list per realm, from the 656 catalog checked against the real controls.

  python3 tools/realm_study_report.py

Keeps every catalog row that is a real control (one row per real control: duplicates fold into the first), adds the real
controls the catalog does not have, sets aside protective actions and non-controls, and writes
docs/realm_study/TRUE_MUSCLES.csv and docs/realm_study/WAVE3_REPORT.md.
