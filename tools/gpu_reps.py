"""The GPU bench table (scripts/gpu_paired.sh): native / watch (Omni runs, writes nothing) / omni (Omni writes power limits).

Every energy number comes from the device: joules = the time integral of nvidia-smi power.draw over the measured window
(trapezoid rule on its own sample timestamps), summed over the measured GPUs; the CPU package joules come from RAPL
energy counters when the machine has them. Nothing here is a model.

Per repetition, per arm: energy, joules per served request, mean power, peak and mean temperature, served and not
served requests, response time (mean, 95th, 99th percentile), power-limit writes. Across repetitions: for watch and omni
against native, the paired mean difference with a t-based 95% interval. A difference is proven when that interval
excludes zero; otherwise the table says not proven.

Three contrasts, each paired by repetition: observation = watch − native (does Omni's presence alone move the plant),
authority = omni − watch (what granting Omni the write adds), total = omni − native (the preregistered comparison).
Three receipts, kept apart: A the governor's decisions (audit.jsonl), B its actuator records (requested, return code,
read-back, enforced limit, delay), C the bench's own nvidia-smi samples and the workload's requests. From A and B the
table also reports actuator fidelity, control effort, and how well the engine's six-state projection matches what the
telemetry shows next (the intertwining residual and directional accuracy), defined in docs/GPU_PREREGISTRATION.md.
The result label is chosen by rule (label()), never by hand. A meter that was not fitted prints UNAVAILABLE.

The run is INVALID (exit 2) when: a native or watch arm saw a power limit (or enforced limit) other than the one read at
start, the watch arm executed a write, an arm ended with a limit that differs from the start (the reset did not
restore), a governor exited nonzero (a refused write, a refused start), a write was refused, Omni's frozen files
changed, a confirmation ran on uncommitted code, or smoke and confirmation repetitions were mixed.
