"""A public demand trace turned into the load schedule of the real Kubernetes test (docs/TRACES_PREREGISTRATION.md).

The six Kubernetes tests drive the cluster with load schedules of our own (1 2 3 2 3 4 ...). A referee may ask whether
the shape of our own schedules flatters the governor. This tool derives a schedule from a demand trace somebody else
published, by a rule written before the runs, and writes a receipt that lets anyone re-derive it:

  Google cluster-usage traces 2011 (clusterdata-2011-2, the job_events table, public): the number of jobs submitted
  (event type 0) in each hour of the trace's first day (the trace starts at 600 s; events stamped 0 are jobs that
  existed before the trace and are not counted). 24 hourly counts.

  Mapping (the rule the organism runs already use, docs/K8S_COMPASS_PREREGISTRATION.md): the counts are placed on the
  load generator's range by min and max, r_raw(k) = LOAD_MIN + round((LOAD_MAX - LOAD_MIN) (c_k - min c) / (max c - min c)),
  LOAD_MIN 1, LOAD_MAX 8 (the wandering test's peak). Then the founder's rule for real traffic (the amendment to the
  wandering test, 2026-10-04): the schedule moves one step a bin toward the trace's level, never skipping; the first bin
  starts at its own level. Each bin is replayed as one step of 108 s (the wandering test's step), 24 steps, 2,592 s a day:
  a day in 43 minutes. The raw levels and the stepped schedule are both in the receipt.

Usage: python tools/trace_schedule.py --out results/traces/google2011 [--cache DIR] [--max-parts 24]
  writes <out>/schedule.json (the receipt: source, parts, their SHA-256, the counts, the levels, the steps, the rule),
  <out>/LOAD_STEPS.txt (the one line the workflow takes as load_steps) and prints both. Needs the network for the
  download (about 0.8 MB a part, 16 parts for a day); a cache directory keeps the parts for re-derivation offline."""
