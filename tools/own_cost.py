"""The governor's own cost at 1, 10, 100 and 1,000 copies (docs/ROBUSTNESS_PREREGISTRATION.md, scenario 3), from runs

every command it ran, over the window, as a share of one core), written by the controller at exit. Nothing is rerun. Each
archived run is tabulated under the engine its commit carries (tools/omni_version.py), and nothing is read across engines.
