"""The seal: every law that exists in Python and in C++, locked together.

  python3 tools/seal.py            # build the C++, run every twin's parity test, and only if all pass write SEAL.json
  python3 tools/seal.py --check    # compare the files with SEAL.json (verify.py runs this)

SEAL.json (results/SEAL.json) records, for each twin, the SHA-256 of its Python file and of its C++ files, the parity
test that proved them equal, and when. A change to either side of a twin breaks the seal until its parity test passes
again and the seal is rewritten, so the Python and the C++ can never drift apart unnoticed. Mechanisms that exist in
Python only are listed too, so nobody takes them for twinned.
