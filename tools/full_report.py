        ("What happens if Omni-Compass crashes or is switched off?", "The reset restores every setting it changed and returns "
         "control to Kubernetes' own controllers; this was exercised live and in simulation. A crashed controller writes nothing further."),
        ("Can it make things worse?", "Every action passes the shield first; it never goes below the capacity running and pending work "
         "needs, and never changes more than the step limit. In the held-out benchmark it had fewer safety violations than Kubernetes. "
         "Its real costs are listed in sections 1 and 5.1."),
        ("How fast does it decide, and what does it cost to run?", "One decision per 60 s on live Kubernetes (300 s in the replica), "
         "with a 15 s fast path that adds nodes for pending pods. The engine takes about 2.9 microseconds per decision."),
        ("Why does it save energy?", "In the pre-registered stack study mainly by power capping and load shaping (fewer minutes over "
         "the power limit, lower peak), while keeping slightly more machines on. On the live cluster it took machines out of service "
         "(6 to 3 workers) and packed replicas more densely; that saves energy only if the parked machines sleep or power off. With "
         "parked machines on standby the live saving was about zero, so live savings must come from power caps and CPU power states."),
        ("Does it slow applications down?", "It can, in the energy-first fleet mode: its HPA target floor packs pods too hot for "
         "latency-sensitive services (section 14). Live, the first all-muscle run was slower (p95 +65%); after the fixes run 4 was a tie at "
