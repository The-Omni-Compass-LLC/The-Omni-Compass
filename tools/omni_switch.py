"""The kill switch, from the command line (security: Omni-Compass off everywhere at once).
The master switch for the whole Omni-Compass harness (omnicompass/master.py).

  python3 tools/omni_switch.py off [--reason TEXT] [--wait 60]
      turns every Omni-Compass governor on this machine off at once: sets the switch, signals every running governor
      (SIGTERM), and waits until each has put every setting back and exited. Exit 0 when all are gone, 1 if any is
      still running after --wait seconds (its name and pid are printed; the switch stays OFF).
  python3 tools/omni_switch.py on
      allows governors to be started again (nothing restarts by itself)
  python3 tools/omni_switch.py status
      OFF or ON, every governor running, and any that died without handing back
  python3 tools/omni_switch.py watchdog [--stale 60] [--every 10] [--once]
      puts back every setting of any governor that died or hung without doing it itself (its recorded restore commands),
      stopping a hung one first; run it as its own service next to the governors

OMNI_MASTER_OFF sets the switch file (default /tmp/omni-compass/OFF); every governor and this tool must agree on it.
