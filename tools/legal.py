"""The legal notice, written once, and the check that it stands everywhere.

The founder's orders of 10 October 2026: every page, table, report, script, workflow run, export and chat answer about
Omni-Compass carries "all rights reserved" and "all patents, copyrights and trademarks filed in the USA" followed by
www.omni-compass.com and nothing after it, at its top and at its end, the way a company protects a released asset. Two
earlier sentences of the notice were retired the same evening and may stand nowhere (RETIRED; --check fails on them). This
module holds the one wording and the machinery that keeps it in place.

  python3 tools/legal.py --check           every file that lacks the notice or still carries an older wording; exit 1 if any
  python3 tools/legal.py --fix [PATH...]   write the notice wherever it is missing or old (all files, or only those under PATH)
  python3 tools/legal.py --summary         the notice as a workflow run's report opens with it (--summary-end: as it closes)
  python3 tools/legal.py --bundle DIR      put README.md, LICENSE, NOTICE, DISCLOSURES.md, PATENTS.md, TRADEMARKS.md into DIR

Where it goes: Markdown pages carry it under their title and again at their end; source files, scripts and workflows carry
it in their header; every workflow opens and closes each job's report with it and hands out the legal files beside the files
it produces (`legal-notice`); every zip and export carries the bundle above.

Locked files keep their bytes: the engine's fingerprinted files (tools/omni_version.py), the C++ twins under the seal
(results/SEAL.json), the reference engine (reference/PROVENANCE.json), the pre-registered harness files
(results/PREREGISTRATION.json, results/fleet/PREREGISTRATION.json) and the dated source snapshot under docs/handoff/. One
changed byte there would break a recorded fingerprint, so their headers are rewritten with the next engine version, never in
between; --check counts them as locked, not as missing. Data files (JSON, CSV, logs, archived run files) carry no comments:
REUSE.toml and the LICENSE beside them cover them, and third-party data keeps its own notice."""
