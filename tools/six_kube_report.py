"""The six organisms with the real cluster inside: twelve columns, one report.

Reads every bench-<arm>-<rep>/ under DIR that carries organism.json (tools/run_kil.py, started by scripts/kind_bench.sh
with ORGANISM set), groups the runs by organism, and pairs each Omni arm with native by repetition. Each organism gives
two columns, native and native with Omni-Compass on top: six organisms, twelve columns.

Two kinds of rows, kept apart:
  the cluster  real Kubernetes, measured (response times from the probe, pods, replicas and CPU from the API server;
               energy from the declared power model; on AKS the bill from Azure's own count of machines)
  the organism the simulated stacks around it (evidence S, models): work, energy, time over the line

Each organism's line names what came out better and what came out worse than native, by any amount, and which of
those are inside the noise (the interval crosses zero). CPU and host load are shown, not judged. No line is drawn.

  python3 tools/six_kube_report.py DIR [DIR ...] [--out FILE.md]   ->  DIR/SIX_KUBE.md and .json (the first DIR), or FILE.md and
  FILE.json; several DIRs when one benchmark's cells were archived from more than one run (the big organisms: the tower from
  the job-bound run, the stack from the detached machine's collection)
