"""The A/B/C table for the robot arms (docs/OMNI_V1.md, docs/ROBOTICS_PREREGISTRATION.md): each robot run three times as
separate GitHub runs on the same frozen engine (tools/run_mujoco.py). MuJoCo is deterministic, so the runs must give the
same numbers: a gauge reads confirmed better or confirmed WORSE by its sign when all three runs agree, same when the
change is under one part in a million, and "the runs differ" when they do not reproduce. A robot whose paired physics
trial left the override native is listed as "nothing for Omni to move"; a robot whose own servo cannot do the task is
listed with the runner's reason. Every row is reported, losses included.
Usage: python tools/mujoco_abc.py A_DIR B_DIR C_DIR --out results/live/V1_MUJOCO.md
  each DIR is an archived run (results/live/raw/run-<id>/) holding mujoco-<robot>/<robot>.json"""
