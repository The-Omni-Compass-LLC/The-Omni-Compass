"""Omni-Compass on top of a database's own connection pooler (docs/POSTGRES_PREREGISTRATION.md).

PostgreSQL (the PostgreSQL Global Development Group) runs as the distribution ships it; PgBouncer (its own project) sits
in front of it in transaction pooling with the pool size it ships with, 20 server connections; pgbench (PostgreSQL's own
benchmark) offers the load. That is native: the pooler's fixed pool is the DBA's one setting, made once.

omni is the same database, the same pooler and the same load, with the compass law (omnicompass/compass_law.py) on
one knob: the pooler's pool size, written through its own admin console (SET default_pool_size), inside the cover
[2, 90]. The reading is the service time the pooler itself reports every second (transaction time plus the time clients
waited for a server, per transaction), or the share of its clients queued for a server scaled to the line, whichever is
worse (amendment 1), on a band from 0 to the response line. Past the wall the knob is handed back to
the pooler's own setting at once (fail up). At the end it is handed back and read back.

Load: pgbench at a fixed client count, rate-limited, the rate stepping one notch at a time (1 2 3 2 3 4 5 6 5 4 3 2 1 2
1) with the base rate set before the counted runs by one native-only run with no rate limit (the peak notch offers
native's own unlimited capacity). Both arms run the same steps, paired, the order alternating between repetitions.

Gauges (from pgbench's per-transaction log, PgBouncer's SHOW POOLS and the host's /proc/stat): work inside the
response line (transactions a second whose latency, lag included, was within the line), throughput, p50/p95/p99
latency, failed transactions, server connections alive (the "machines"), the host's CPU busy share and CPU-seconds.
There is no watt-meter on a GitHub runner: nothing here is an energy claim.

Amendment 2 (docs/POSTGRES_PREREGISTRATION.md, declared before the second counted set): the console is read over one
connection held for the whole arm (class Console, the server's own wire protocol) instead of a psql process launched for
every reading, which was about five launches a second in the omni arm at about 50 ms of CPU each and was the CPU the
first counted set charged to Omni; the queue line: a server is taken back (the calm give-back and the slow-inside-the-server
shrink alike) only while the pooler's clients waited for a server under one percent of its time in the last second and a
transaction was served, and while they waited one percent or more one server a second is added back, up to the pooler's own
setting; the harness's own CPU is recorded beside the host's.

Usage:
  python tools/run_pgbench.py --setup                      # create the bench role and database (needs the postgres user)
  python tools/run_pgbench.py --workloads tpcb --reps 3 --out out
  python tools/run_pgbench.py --report-only all --out all  # re-read finished <workload>.json files and write PGBENCH.md
