"""The two-wire GPU card in simulation (realms/gpu_card.py; evidence class S). Each base runs alone and with Omni-Compass
on top, on the same seeds (5000-5009 tuning, 5100-5109 fresh), 600 s each, for two kinds of work: compute-bound (the
bench's pinned matrix products) and AI token generation (85% of a request's time waiting on memory). Bases: the card's
own firmware (native) and an operator's fixed 105 W power cap. Writes results/sim/gpu_two_wire/."""
