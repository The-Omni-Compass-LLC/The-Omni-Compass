"""Omni-Compass on one GPU box, no Kubernetes: the engine reads each GPU's own meter and may lower its power limit.

Every decision (--interval seconds), for each GPU in --gpus:
  sense     nvidia-smi: power.draw, temperature.gpu, utilization.gpu, power.limit (the device's own readings)
            the workload's response-time file (--latency-file, elapsed_seconds,latency_ms,ok) if given
  engine    the Omni-Compass governor, throughput law (omnicompass/adapter.py): load = utilization, power stress =
            draw / the limit found at start, heat = temperature / --temp-limit, queue = response-time pressure.
            Its directive power_cap is the share of the start limit the GPU may draw.
  shield    limit = max(cap x start limit, draw x (1 + --headroom), --min-share x start limit, the device's minimum
            limit), never above the start limit; whole watts; a change under --min-change-w is not written.
            --min-share bounds the slowdown: a card held at that share of its limit runs a burst only a little slower.
  busy gate utilization (smoothed over decisions) at or above --util-gate: the start limit. A busy card is the
            bottleneck; slowing it grows the queue faster than it saves energy. The cap returns once utilization is
            back under the gate less --util-band.
  reflexes  a blind sense (nvidia-smi unreadable, or the response-time file stale or empty): the start limit, at once
            a response-time breach (p95 > --slo-ms), and for --slo-clear decisions after it: the start limit, at once
  read-back no new write until the last one is read back from the device (power.limit within 1 W of what I wrote)
  enforced  the card obeys enforced.power.limit, which another authority (a lower board or system limit) can hold under
            the limit I request. The engine senses the enforced limit; each write is read back at once (requested,
            return code, power.limit, enforced limit, delay), and enforced under requested is recorded as an override.
            A driver without enforced.power.limit: power.limit is used and the snapshot says so.
  speed lock (--baseline-file, from tools/gpu_baseline.py on a run without Omni): the limit is set by response time
            alone. Over the last --lock-window-s of the response-time file, the mean, 95th and 99th percentile are each
            divided by the baseline's at the same arrival rate; the worst of the three is the speed ratio. The line is
            1 - --speed-gain (0.99: at least 1% faster than without Omni). Above the line: the start limit, at once.
            Under the line less --lock-margin: lower by --lock-step x start, times the slack in margins (up to
            --lock-boost), at most once per --lock-hold-s (the window must see the step before the next). Between: held. Never under --lock-floor x start.
            Speed won elsewhere (CPU conveyed to the serving pods, shorter queues) shows as a ratio under the line,
            and the lock spends it on watts; with nothing won elsewhere it holds the start limit.
  one writer the limit must be what I last wrote (or the start limit). Any other value means another writer: I stop
            writing for the rest of the run (observe only), record "foreign_writer", leave its limit alone on kill
            (restoring would fight it), and exit 5 so the bench marks the run invalid. Two controllers on one limit is
            how production is lost.
  heat      the device reporting a thermal or hardware slowdown (clock-limit reasons 0x8, 0x20, 0x40, 0x80): never
            tighten; the limit may only stay or rise (fail up).
  envelope  every decision records every rule that held the engine's request back ("blocked_by") and the one that
            decided ("decided_by": engine, a floor, the busy gate, a reflex, heat, or the speed lock), so a limit that
            did not move names its cause, and a result is credited to the rule that produced it.
  envelope  --floor-w, the buyer's declared lowest watts (the confirmation run requires it, scripts/gpu_paired.sh
  floor     ENVELOPE): the limit is never set under it. The highest watts are the limit read at start.
  outer     when the card's own controller (board, BMC or system policy) already holds enforced.power.limit under the
  holds     limit I set, a lower write that stays above that enforced value would change nothing the card does: it is
            not written ("outer_controller_holds"). Only a write that would actually bind, or a return upward, goes out.
Modes
  watch     everything above is computed and audited; nothing is written (the control arm)
  cap       the limit is written with nvidia-smi -i <gpu> -pl <W>. Refused at start unless every GPU reports
            power.management Enabled. A write the device refuses (nonzero return) ends the run: recorded, the start
            limit restored, exit 4, and the bench marks the arm invalid. No clock locks are ever written.
Kill switch
  the kill file (or SIGTERM) restores every GPU to the limit read at start, reads it back, and exits.
  The start limits are recorded first in the audit ("snapshot": power.limit, enforced.power.limit, default, min,
  max, persistence mode, power management, per GPU).
