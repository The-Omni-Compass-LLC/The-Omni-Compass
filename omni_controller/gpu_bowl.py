"""Omni-Compass on one GPU through two wires: the bowl law (omnicompass/bowl.py) on a real card.

The card keeps its own control: NVIDIA's firmware still boosts and still protects the chip. Omni holds two settings the
card already accepts, and nothing else:
  up wire    the clock ceiling: how high boost may climb (nvidia-smi -lgc MIN,MAX; -rgc resets it)
  down wire  the power limit: the lid above what that ceiling draws (nvidia-smi -pl W)

Every decision (--interval seconds):
  read      nvidia-smi: power.draw, temperature, utilization, power.limit, clocks.sm; the workload's response times
  position  the service as one place in its bowl, 0 calm to 1 the line: response time only (the mean over the last
            --latency-window-s, between a tenth of the line, the bare service time, and the line; the 95th percentile at
            or past the line, or a failed request, is past the wall). A card that is busy is doing its work; being busy
            is not a breach and is not read as one
  native    what the card does on its own, learned from its own meter before the bowl may lower anything: while the
            ceiling is at the top and the card is busy, its clock and its draw (the clock its own power limit holds it
            at, and what that costs). Until --learn-samples busy readings are in, the ceiling stays at the top
  race      while the card is saturated (utilization at or over --race-util: work is waiting), the ceiling goes to the
            top and the lid to the start limit, so a burst is served at full speed; the bowl paces only the slack
  force     the bowl: pull to the center, push against what is rising, tanh-bounded; past the 0.95 wall: fail up
  verdict   how far the ceiling may go (omnicompass/verdict.py): while the service is calm, a paired trial: the ceiling
            at the top until --verdict-samples requests are measured, then one 15 MHz step past the deepest step
            already allowed until as many again are measured; the card's own time on each request (the workload's
            service_ms, the wait in the queue left out) is compared: at most --allow slower and the step is allowed,
            slower than that and it is refused and not tried again for --verdict-recheck decisions. Where no step
            passes, the ceiling stays at the top: the card runs as it does alone
  law       down gain 0.0125, the bowl's center at 0.4, the speed floor at the card's own busy clock (amendment 8)
  steady    while the card is saturated against its own power limit (work waiting and the draw at the limit), the
            firmware boosts a step, hits the limit and is knocked back: a sawtooth. The ceiling is then held at the
            card's own busy clock under that limit (what the sawtooth averages to), so the same watts serve the work
            without the knock-backs (amendment 9). It never holds under that clock, and blind always fails up
  write     up wire: the ceiling moves by the force (fast up, gently down), inside its cover: from the card's own busy
            clock (never slower than native while there is work) to the top; down wire: the lid at the card's own busy
            draw plus --lid-headroom, never under it and never over the start limit, inside the declared envelope;
            fail up: ceiling to the top and the lid to the start limit at once
  guards    blind (meters unreadable, response times stale): fail up; heat (the card reports a thermal or hardware
            slowdown): never tighten; one writer: a power limit neither mine nor the start means another writer, so
            observe only from then on and exit 5; read-back: every write is read back
  restore   on exit, kill file or SIGTERM: clocks reset (-rgc) and the power limit back to the start, read back

The audit (--audit) carries the same records the bench reads from the one-wire governor (snapshot, decision with
telemetry and decided_by, write and actuator for each power-limit write, restored), plus clock_write records.
Exit: 0 clean, 3 restore failed, 4 a write refused, 5 another writer.
