"""Omni-Compass live controller for a real Kubernetes cluster.

Modes
  observe   read the cluster every interval, run the fleet-mode governor in OBSERVE, log every decision; no writes (default)
  target    additionally patch each HPA's CPU averageUtilization to rho* (bounded, rate-limited); the Cluster Autoscaler and
            all node management remain unchanged
  nodepool  additionally size one node pool to the governor's recommendation through --node-scale-cmd, a command template
            such as "aws autoscaling set-desired-capacity --auto-scaling-group-name POOL --desired-capacity {n}"; the
            Cluster Autoscaler must not manage that pool
Laws (--law)
  governor  (default) the engine's allocation law sets the HPA target (rho*) and the closure law or the governor sizes the pool
  bowl      the bowl law (omnicompass/bowl.py) holds the service in its band, read as the GPU bowl reads it: the mean
            response time of the latency window between the bare service time (a tenth of --slo-ms) and --slo-ms, held at
            --bowl-center (0.4); p95 at or past the SLO, a blind sense or pods waiting for a place read as past the wall. Its push and pull move two levers: each HPA's CPU target inside its cover (from 60% of the
            operator's target up to the operator's own, never tighter than native, so it only ever adds pods and gives them
            back) and the node pool (one machine back only while the force is clearly down, the position below the center
            and the nervous system's release gate open; past the 0.95 wall, one machine up at once). The verdict
            (omnicompass/verdict.py, stepwise) decides how many machines may be given back at all: while the service is
            calm, one more machine is given back on trial and the response time of the requests served without it is set
            against the requests served just before and against the cluster as it ran on its own at the start; at most
            --allow slower and that machine stays given back, slower than that and it is taken back and not tried again
            for --verdict-recheck decisions. Where no machine passes, the pool stays as the cluster runs it alone. The
            six-state engine still runs every decision: it grants the authority, feeds the release gate and the compass,
            and is audited
Safety
  every node action passes through the shield (bounds, step limit); the recommendation never falls below what the CPU
  requests of running and pending pods, or current usage, need, and capacity required by that floor is added in one step
  (the step limit applies only to the governor's own adjustments); --dry-run logs intended writes without executing them; creating the kill file (or
  setting OMNI_KILL=1) restores every HPA target this controller changed, runs --node-restore-cmd if given, and returns to
  observe; every decision and action
  is appended to the audit log.
Requires kubectl on PATH with access to the cluster (metrics-server for kubectl top).
