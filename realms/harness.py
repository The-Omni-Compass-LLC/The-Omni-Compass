"""Realm harness: every muscle native, watched and governed; every realm, and the whole tower, as one organism.

Arms, all on the same seed (the same demand, weather, disturbances):
  native  the plant and its native controller alone
  watch   the frozen governor reads the plant every period and writes nothing; must equal native exactly
  omni    the frozen governor holds the muscle's one knob; at 90% of the run it is killed, the knob returns to the
          native controller, and the harness checks that it did

The governor is omnicompass.adapter.Governor, unchanged (the engine with u = 0, the stack law, the reset).

Single muscle: one plant, one governor reading that plant.
Organism: all the plants of a realm (or the whole tower) on one 15 s clock, coupled: the electrical power of compute, motion
and process plants is heat in the realm's thermal zones; the organism's load swing is load on its storage sites; the
zones' temperature is the ambient every other plant reports. One governor reads the organism's aggregate and its one
directive sets every muscle's knob.

Primary outcome per seed: work per energy, omni against native: (work_omni / work_native) / (energy_omni /
energy_native) - 1. For an organism, work is the mean over its plants of work_omni / work_native (their work units
differ) and energy is total joules. Guardrails: work not lower by more than 1%; the share of periods in violation not
higher by more than 1 percentage point. Labels by rule (label()).
