"""The bowl law on every realm muscle (omnicompass/bowl.py): each plant's knob held by its own bowl.

Each plant's service is read as one position in its bowl (0 calm, 1 the line): the worst of its queue or lateness, its
load above half, and, for a storage site, its draw on the grid connection above half. The last period in violation
reads as past the wall (fail up). The bowl's force moves the knob: a positive force adds capacity, power, cooling or
protection, a negative force gives it back, each knob inside its own cover. At the kill every knob returns to native.

Knob by plant (the override key the plant already obeys, its native value, its cover, and which way is "more"):
  compute_pool   power: limit share 0.4-1; replicas-type: the HPA target held at native (loosening it past the
                 operator's own costs the service time, the same rule as the card's speed floor); machine pools: one
                 machine released while the force is clearly down and the machines left cover the recent peak with
                 margin (RELEASE_MARGIN); admission: native
  thermal_zone   setpoint between the band's stress (colder, more cooling) and calm ends; units: one released while the
                 force is clearly down; power: 0.5-1
  energy_storage reserve between the band's ends (a lower reserve gives the battery to the site); power: native
  motion_axis    speed and effort: 0.4-1
  process_loop   setpoint from native toward the band's calm end; actuator range 0.3-1; power 0.4-1
