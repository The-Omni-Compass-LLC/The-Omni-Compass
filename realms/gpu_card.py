"""A GPU card on its real physics, its own firmware, and the two-wire plug (evidence class S: a model, not a meter).

The card
  clock     f, a share of the top clock (1.0), moved by the firmware in bins of 0.9% (about 15 MHz on a 1.7 GHz part)
  power     P = idle + leakage(T) + P_dyn x busy x f x V(f)^2, with V(f) = 0.6 + 0.4 f: dynamic power rises with the
            clock and with the square of the voltage the clock needs, so the top of the clock range costs the most
  heat      C dT/dt = P - (T - T_amb) / R_th; leakage rises with temperature
  work      requests arrive (a slow wave, bursts, noise, drawn from the seed); the card serves f x mu per second;
            a request's response time is its wait plus its service time

The firmware (native, what ships on the card), 50 times a second
  boost     while there is work and room, raise the clock one bin, up to the clock ceiling
  hammer    while the draw is over the power limit, or the chip is over its slowdown temperature, drop three bins
  So the clock saws against the limit for as long as the work keeps coming: up a bin, knocked down three, up again.

The work
  memb      the share of a request's time at the top clock spent waiting on memory, which does not speed up with the
            clock: 0 is compute-bound work (large matrix products, the bench's pinned workload), 0.85 is typical of AI
            token generation (each token streams the model's weights from memory). The card serves 1 / ((1 - memb) / f
            + memb) of its top speed

The arms: each base alone, and the same base with Omni-Compass on top (Omni never runs the card itself)
  native    the card as shipped: power limit 150 W, clock ceiling at the top, firmware alone
  omni      native + Omni-Compass on top, through two wires (omnicompass/compass_law.py): the clock ceiling is the up wire (how
            high boost may push), the power limit is the down wire (the lid, set just above what the ceiling draws,
            never under the card's own busy draw). The compass's reading is the response time as a position between the
            bare service time (0) and the service line (1); the brain pulls it to the center. The verdict
            (omnicompass/verdict.py) decides how far the ceiling may go: a step down is allowed only after a paired
            trial shows it costs each request at most ALLOW of the card's own time on it; where no step passes, the
            ceiling stays where the firmware has it. Both wires are restored to their snapshot at 90% of the run
  cap       a fixed power cap set by the operator and left (105 W, 70%), firmware alone under it
  cap_omni  the cap + Omni-Compass on top: the same law, the lid never above the operator's cap
