"""Realm plants: the machines the muscles act on (evidence class S: declared models, not meters).

Five plant models. Each one carries its own native controller and runs correctly with no Omni at all:

  compute_pool    servers, nodes, GPUs, robots, radio cells or workers serving a request stream; native: the Kubernetes
                  HPA rule (desired = ceil(n * utilisation / target), 10% tolerance, scale-down stabilisation window,
                  start-up delay), a fixed admission limit, full clock
  thermal_zone    a data hall or building zone cooled by staged units; native: PI on a fixed setpoint, units staged to
                  the load, chiller COP from supply and outdoor temperature
  energy_storage  a site with load, solar and a battery behind a grid connection; native: self-consumption above a
                  fixed reserve
  motion_axis     a joint, flight axis, spacecraft axis or vehicle doing point-to-point moves from a task queue;
                  native: PID with feedforward at full speed, motor heating and derating
  process_loop    a first-order process with dead time (level, pressure, chamber temperature, feeder voltage);
                  native: PI on a fixed setpoint, pump or heater power from the actuator

A muscle is one knob of one plant. Omni may hold that knob and only that one; the native controller keeps the rest.
Omni commands a knob the way the shipped controller commands its organs (omni_controller/controller.py,
omni_controller/muscles.py), through the nervous system's authority (omnicompass/nervous_system.py, from_governor):

  expand     adding capacity, performance or protection is always allowed (except during a security hold)
  contract   giving any of it back (fewer machines, a lower speed or power limit, a warmer setpoint, a lower reserve
             of protection) only while the organ has contraction authority (calm >= the organ's threshold, senses live)
             and the plant's service has been clean for the last three decisions (the SLO reflex); continuous organs
             shed at most the calm fraction of their surplus per decision, discrete organs one unit, through a release
             gate (nothing waiting, and after the release the rest runs at or under the engine's utilisation target)
  fail up    while service is breached, the knob returns to the native controller at once
  pacing     admission muscles are batch pacing (the live batch_pace muscle): one muscle's work suspended per decision
             while power stress >= 0.95 or heat >= 0.96 or the nervous system calls a pause; one resumed per decision
             once power stress <= 0.8 and heat < 0.90 (realms/harness.py, pace)

By plant and knob:
  compute_pool  replicas and HPA-type knobs: the HPA target written as min(rho*, the operator's target), never tighter,
                held for one autoscaler window (the live controller's rule); machine pools (Cluster Autoscaler native):
                the node release gate; power: the GPU or CPU-frequency envelope, never under the work's draw plus 30%,
                and never on a request-served pool (the live controller: throttling it saves no energy, only adds
                wait); admission: batch pacing of pausable work only (request traffic is never paused)
  thermal_zone  setpoint: the live cooling law (warm while cool, cold as heat rises, inside [stress, stress + band x
                calm]); units: the release gate; power: the site power envelope above the load plus 10%; admission:
                paced, the migratable 10% is shed
  energy_storage reserve by power stress (released under stress, held when calm only with authority); peak-shave
                ceiling at rho* of the connection (expand only); battery power: the site power envelope; admission:
                paced, the flexible share is deferred; resumed, it is caught up
  motion_axis   speed: up at once to demand, down by the calm share of the surplus; effort: the power envelope;
                admission: paced, no new move starts
  process_loop  setpoint: toward the efficient end of its band by the calm share; actuator range: as motion speed;
                power: the site power envelope above use plus 10%; admission: paced, 10% is shed

Every disturbance trace is drawn from the seed when the plant is built, so all arms of a seed see the same ones.
Meters (work, energy_j, viol, steps) are kept by the plant from its own state; Omni never supplies them.
