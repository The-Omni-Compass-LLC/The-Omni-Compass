"""Closure governor: machines governed by the Omni-Compass closure law, preemptive coherence and the dual-bath tracker.

Sources (the owner's manuscript): Section 5 (5c preemptive coherence: forward projection tau_fwd = Phi_dt(x) and
correction -lambda grad psi), Chapter 20 (master closure law F = G0 + Gc, Gc = -rho beta Dh, zero in the interior,
inward near the boundary with margin delta), Chapters 29-30 (the wheel: expansion, turning point dE/dt = 0, compression;
release only after the turn, ignition before the threshold), Chapter 31 (dual-bath exchange dU/dt = -alpha E + beta S,
dE/dt = alpha U - gamma B).

Cluster realisation (one pool)
  state        r(t)  requested cores (what the pods ask for);  n machines;  c = cores x ALLOC per machine
  dual bath    level L and rate v of r, the exchange pair of Chapter 31 in discrete form:
                 innovation e = r - (L + v dt)
                 L <- L + v dt + a e          (coherence bath absorbs the observation)
                 v <- (1 - g) v + b e / dt    (deviation bath exchanges with it; g = redistribution damping)
  projection   r_fwd(tau) = L + v tau  for tau in [0, H]          (5c: Phi over the look-ahead horizon)
  admissible   h(tau) = r_fwd(tau) / (n c) - rho_max  <= 0      (Chapter 20: the admissible domain)
  closure Gc   if max_{tau <= H_add} h(tau) > -delta (projected boundary approach, within one boot of lead):
                 add k = ceil( (max r_fwd / (rho_max - delta) - n c) / c ) machines        (beta sized to restore delta)
  interior G0  energy descent: remove one machine only if it stays admissible with margin for the whole release horizon,
                 max_{tau <= H_rel} r_fwd(tau) / ((n - 1) c) <= rho_max - delta,
               and only after the turn (v <= 0: past the peak, the metric flip), and only while the six-state engine's
               equation (2) push <= push_release
  interior     nothing else happens: inside the domain the platform physics runs unmodified (Gc = 0)
