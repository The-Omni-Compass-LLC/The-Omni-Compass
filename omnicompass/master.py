"""The kill switch (the master switch): one OFF for the whole harness, not one muscle at a time.

Its purpose is security: if anything gets into Omni-Compass's brain and tries to drive a system for its own ends, or
anything rogue happens, one switch in a human hand turns Omni-Compass's governing off everywhere at once. It is not
the reset (the brake held to the floor at the end of a run, which hands one governor's settings back).

Every Omni-Compass governor on a machine (the Kubernetes controller, the GPU governors, any muscle they drive) obeys one
switch, in a human hand:

  OFF   the switch file exists (OMNI_MASTER_OFF, by default /tmp/omni-compass/OFF). Every running governor sees it at its
        next decision, puts every setting it ever wrote back to the value it read before its first write, reads each one
        back, writes its last audit line and exits. No governor starts while the switch is OFF.
  ON    the switch file is removed. Nothing restarts by itself: a governor runs again only when someone starts it.

The switch is also pulled from the command line, which signals every registered governor at once so none waits for its
next decision:

  python3 tools/omni_switch.py off [--reason TEXT]    turn the whole harness off, wait for every governor to restore
  python3 tools/omni_switch.py on                      allow governors to be started again
  python3 tools/omni_switch.py status                  OFF or ON, and every governor running

A governor that cannot read the switch (a filesystem it cannot reach) treats that as OFF: when in doubt, hand back.

If a governor dies without handing back (killed outright, the machine crashed, it hung), nothing it wrote may be left
in place. So every governor records, before its first write, the exact commands that put every setting back, and
renews a lease every decision. The watchdog finds any governor whose process is gone or whose lease is older than its
limit and runs those commands for it:

  python3 tools/omni_switch.py watchdog [--stale 60] [--every 10]    keep watching (run it as its own service)
  python3 tools/omni_switch.py watchdog --once                       one pass
