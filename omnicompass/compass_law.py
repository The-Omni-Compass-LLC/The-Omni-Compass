"""The compass: one smooth law for every muscle, and the plug every muscle is wired through.

A muscle is a plug with one wire in and one wire out. The plug reads its meters and writes its lever; all the
thinking is here, in the brain, written once for every muscle.

The plug (Plug)
  read      the service reading (response time, temperature, queue) and the lever as it stands
  write     one value; the plug clips it to the cover, sends it, and reads back what the device took
  restore   the lever back to the snapshot, the value read once before the first write; it never moves after that
  one writer if the lever is found at a value the brain did not write, someone else owns it: the brain stops writing
            and leaves that value alone (restoring over it would fight the new owner)

Two bands
  cover     the outer band, the lever's hard range (the device's or the buyer's lowest and highest setting); every
            write is clipped to it, so nothing the math does can set the lever outside
  compass      the service reading as a position in its band, 0 to 1 (0: calm, 1: the service line); the brain pulls it
            to the bottom of the compass, the center (0.5 by default); the walls run to 0.05 and 0.95, and the last 5% on
            each side is cushion (10% in all) before the line

The force (CompassLaw.force), the physics of a ball in a compass with the right friction
  pull      K_P x (position - center): gentle near the bottom, harder up the walls
  push      K_D x velocity: whatever is shoving the position (a load rising, heat building) is met by an equal and
            opposite push; it is also the friction that stops the ball sloshing past the bottom (with K_D chosen for
            critical damping it glides to the center and stops, no overshoot, no ringing)
  smooth    the force is A x tanh(raw / A): a spring near the center that bends over and flattens into its maximum A,
            never a corner, never a hammer; the same shape the engine already uses for v_eff (omnicompass/core.py)
  fail up   past the 0.95 wall the up side goes to its full force at once, and the down side may not act until the
            position is back inside the compass

Two forces (antagonist pairs)
  up        a positive force adds capacity, power, cooling or speed (scale out, raise a clock, start a chiller)
  down      a negative force takes it back (scale in, lower a limit, warm a setpoint)
  each side has its own gain (lever units per unit of force), because adding and taking back do not cost the same;
  a muscle with two wires (a GPU's clock range and power limit) gives each side its own lever; a one-wire muscle
  carries both directions on its one lever

The frozen engine (omnicompass/core.py) and its proofs are untouched; this is a separate law, run as its own arm.
