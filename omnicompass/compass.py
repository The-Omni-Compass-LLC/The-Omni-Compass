"""The Omni-Compass, computed.

I read my own state on the compass every decision and say where I am, in the compass's own terms.

The wheel (Chapter 29). My deviation E, scaled by its ceiling E_max, runs along the horizontal; its rate of change runs
along the vertical. A reading is a point on that wheel. Its heading is measured clockwise from north, as on the face:

    +   Α     0 deg   rising through rest
    ⇄   Δ    45 deg   expansion: above rest and rising, exchange under way
    >   Β    90 deg   peak extension: the turn, where the metric flips (k -> -k)
    ⊤   Λ   135 deg   dispersion: above rest and easing, the ceiling holds
    -   Ω   180 deg   falling through rest
    ≈   Π   225 deg   compression: below rest and settling into the basin
    <   Γ   270 deg   deepest compression: the turn at the floor
    ✦   Ψ   315 deg   re-alignment: below rest and rising, ignition ahead

The four quadrants are the strokes of the closed circle (Chapters 29-30):
    I   Expansion     above rest, rising
    II  Dispersion    above rest, easing
    III Compression   below rest, falling
    IV  Re-alignment  below rest, rising
The wheel turns I -> II -> III -> IV -> I. Crossing from IV into I is ignition; the turn at peak extension is the
metric flip. The state is continuous through every crossing: nothing switches off, nothing restarts.

The rim carries the 24 letters in their places on the face, 15 degrees each, clockwise from Α at north.

The axle is the structural basin S. Its rest point S* solves equation (6): delta - alpha_s S - (3/4) beta_s S^2 = 0.

Closing the circle (Chapter 1, the Unified Circle Principle):
    X' = G(X),  X(0) in Omega           Omega is the living band: every level inside [0.05, 0.95]
    G(X) . n(X) <= 0 on the boundary    at a boundary the next move points inward, never outward
    grad L(X) . G(X) <= 0               the ledger L, the engine's composite storage over all six states
                                        (omnicompass.storage.composite_V), descends when nothing is forcing it
    => lim X(t) in M*                   the state settles into the basin
I check all three every decision and report them. The ledger may rise while outside load forces me; I report that as
forcing, never hide it.
