"""The verdict: Omni-Compass moves a knob only where it measures that the muscle is no worse for it.

Omni-Compass sits on top of a muscle that already works (a card's firmware, an autoscaler, a chiller's loop). It does not
replace that muscle, and it has no reason to move the muscle's knob unless moving it costs the muscle nothing. The
verdict is how the brain finds that out, on the muscle itself, before it acts and again from time to time:

  steps     the knob's settings from native outward, in whole steps (step 0 is native: the muscle as it runs alone)
  cost      what each setting costs the muscle's own work, measured per piece of work (a card: the milliseconds it spends
            on one request, the wait in the queue left out, so more traffic is never mistaken for a slower card)
  probe     while the service is calm, a paired trial: first the knob at native until min_samples pieces of work are
            measured (the reference, fresh, under the same traffic), then at one step past the deepest step already
            allowed until min_samples more are measured
  judge     the trial step's median cost against the reference's: no higher (within the measurement's resolution,
            tolerance) and the step is allowed; higher and it is refused, the knob goes back, and that step is not tried
            again until recheck decisions have passed (the work may have changed). A trial that sees the service leave
            calm is abandoned, and the knob goes back at once
  allowed   the compass may move the knob only between native and the deepest allowed step; where no step is allowed, the
            verdict is "left native" and the knob is never moved

  stepwise  for a knob that is slow to move back (a machine given back takes minutes to return), incremental=True runs
            the reference at the deepest step already allowed instead of at native, and judges the trial step against
            both that reference and the cost first measured at native, so steps can never add up past the allowance

The verdict never makes the knob more aggressive than the law: it only narrows where the law may go. Every probe and
every judgement is returned to the caller for the audit.
