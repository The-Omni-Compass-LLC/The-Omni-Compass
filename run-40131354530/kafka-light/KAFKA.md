Apache Kafka as shipped (one broker, a topic of 8 partitions); native: the consumer group at the operator's count (2); omni: the compass law on the consumer count inside [1, 8], holding the group's own end-to-end latency at 40% of the 500 ms line. The same offered load in both arms. Energy is the host's CPU seconds, the compass's own cost included. Every row is reported, losses included.

## light: 1.0 ms of work a message, 128 B, steps 1 2 3 2 3 4 5 6 5 4 3 2 1 2 1 × 30.0 s

Native capacity 1949 messages a second; base rate 292.4/s; 3 paired repetitions; engine omni-v18 (digest 1cb92edb64c4391d, 62 files) at `791ad0fd93b1`.

| Gauge | native | omni | change | 95% interval of the difference | reading |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| work inside the response line (messages a second handled within the line) | 730 | 729 | -0.3% | -2.57 to -1.3 | LOSS |
| throughput (messages a second consumed) | 857 | 857 | -0.0% | -0.0144 to 0.00397 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| end-to-end latency, 95th percentile (ms) | 2,498 | 2,531 | +1.3% | -23.3 to 89.5 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| end-to-end latency, 99th percentile (ms) | 3,822 | 3,832 | +0.3% | -216 to 237 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| end-to-end latency, median (ms) | 7.37 | 7.33 | -0.6% | -0.0964 to 0.0118 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| end-to-end latency, mean (ms) | 335 | 342 | +1.9% | -14.3 to 27.2 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| consumer lag, most messages waiting at once | 3,435 | 3,440 | +0.1% | -169 to 178 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| consumer lag, mean messages waiting | 294 | 299 | +1.5% | -7.92 to 16.7 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| messages produced and never consumed | 0 | 0 |  | 0 to 0 | EVEN, the same |
| consumers running, mean (the resources held) | 2 | 1.99 | -0.3% | -0.00667 to -0.00663 | GAIN |
| consumers running, most at once | 2 | 2 | +0.0% | 0 to 0 | EVEN, the same |
| host CPU busy (share of the run) | 0.314 | 0.312 | -0.4% | -0.0131 to 0.0106 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds | 559 | 558 | -0.2% | -22 to 19.8 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds per 1,000 messages inside the line | 1.7 | 1.7 | +0.1% | -0.0613 to 0.0637 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| consumer changes written (the knob's moves) | 2 | 4 | +100.0% | 2 to 2 | shown, not judged |

Every omni arm handed back to the operator's count: yes; fail-ups: 3.
