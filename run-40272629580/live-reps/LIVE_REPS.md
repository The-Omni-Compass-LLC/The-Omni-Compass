<!-- how to read this receipt (tools/readings.py) -->
**How to read this receipt.** Every judged row reads one of three words, decided by what its gauge is for and never by the plus or minus sign of its number. **GAIN**: the gauge moved toward its declared aim against native (more work done, a shorter wait, fewer misses or failures, or a resource cut). **EVEN**: native and Omni-Compass within 0.5% of each other (the mean of the three runs' changes under the 0.5% floor, or no change at all), or the knob is at its limit on native. **LOSS**: the gauge moved away from its aim (less work done, a longer wait, more misses or failures). A resource spent or held (energy, the power drawn and its peaks and swings, machines, memory, processor time, a bill, wear) that fell is a cut, a GAIN; one that rose is **power given**, what Omni-Compass put in to buy the work and the speed shown beside it, always shown and never called a loss; work bought with each unit of a resource (work per energy) that fell is power given too. So a minus can read GAIN (a response time cut) and a plus can read LOSS (failed requests up). A change of 0.5% or more, the mean of the three runs' changes, reads GAIN, LOSS or power given: **in all three of our runs** where A, B and C moved the same way with every interval clear of zero, otherwise **by the mean of our three runs**, with the count of runs beyond the noise beside it; **the runs disagree** names runs that moved 0.5% or more in opposite directions, a test unstable there; **shown, not judged** is a gauge declared shown only. The output follows the input: every reading is the result of the tune, the wiring and the load it names, and where a reading elsewhere differs the first presumption is the wiring (`DISCLOSURES.md`, section 4). The full key, letter by letter: `docs/HOW_TO_READ_THE_RESULTS.md`. Run and scored by The Omni-Compass LLC's own code. No outside party has reviewed or approved these results. Preregistered means the rules were written down in our own repository before the runs; nothing was filed with any outside body.

**Energy on kind is a declared model, not a meter.** Every worker stays powered and Ready in every arm; the first
energy row counts a parked worker at its full idle power, which is what kind does. The second counts it at the
declared standby power, which needs a node autoscaler that really removes the machine; this run has none.

**The babysitting tax.** Omni-Compass runs on autopilot: no person touched a setting in either arm. An alert
minute is a whole minute whose 95th percentile, failed requests counted over, was over the line: a minute an
on-call page would be open. The commands are the settings the governor wrote on its own, each in its audit with
its reason; the share decided inside the line counts its additions (a machine more, or a lower HPA target) made
before the line was crossed. The alert minutes are judged; the commands and the share are shown, not judged.

## The capacity test: the same machines, the load rising step by step

Each step adds one load generator (6 requests a second each). A run's capacity is the highest step at which no more than 5% of response samples are over the line or failed (and every lower step held too), the first 30 s of each step left to settle. Paired over the repetitions; a rise is more work from the same machines, a GAIN.

| Arm | Capacity (requests a second), mean | Change against native | 95% interval of the difference (requests a second) | Repetitions |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| native | 19.2 |  |  | 10 |
| compass | 27.0 | +40.6% | +5.7 to +9.9 | 10 |
