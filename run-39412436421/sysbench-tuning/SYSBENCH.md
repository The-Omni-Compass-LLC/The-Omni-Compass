MySQL exactly as Ubuntu ships it, its InnoDB buffer pool at MySQL's own default (128 MB), is native; omni is the compass law on the pool size through the server's own console inside [128, 2048] MB in chunks of 128 MB, holding the server's own statement latency at 40% of the 0.6 ms statement line. sysbench's published OLTP workloads, the same transactions in both arms, the tables in use stepping through the pool and past it. Memory held is the resource; the host's CPU seconds include the compass's own cost. Every row is reported, losses included.

## tuning: sysbench oltp_point_select, 1 statements a transaction, 3000 a second offered, steps 1 2 3 2 3 4 5 6 5 4 3 2 1 2 1 × 30.0 s (the tuning workload)

MySQL 8.0.46-0ubuntu0.24.04.4, sysbench 1.0.20; 32 client threads; the transaction line 0.6 ms; 3 paired repetitions; engine omni-v12 (digest d38b58fbe28939b8, 47 files) at `690b955b1c2a`.

| Gauge | native | omni | change | 95% interval of the difference | reading |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| work inside the response line (transactions a second answered within the line) | 2,961 | 2,961 | +0.0% | -11.9 to 12.6 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| throughput (transactions a second) | 2,966 | 2,965 | -0.0% | -14.1 to 12 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| queries a second | 2,966 | 2,965 | -0.0% | -14.1 to 12 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, 95th percentile (ms) | 0.231 | 0.237 | +2.3% | -0.00614 to 0.0168 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, 99th percentile (ms) | 0.358 | 0.361 | +0.7% | -0.016 to 0.0213 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, mean (ms) | 0.2 | 0.171 | -14.6% | -0.119 to 0.0605 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| errors (sysbench's ignored errors: deadlocks and retries) | 0 | 0 |  | 0 to 0 | EVEN, the same |
| buffer pool held, mean (MB; the knob, the resource) | 128 | 131 | +2.6% | -6.22 to 13 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| pages holding data, mean (MB) | 121 | 127 | +4.6% | -9.43 to 20.5 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| pages read from disk into the pool (misses) | 1,030,826 | 1,019,632 | -1.1% | -40,518 to 18,129 | shown, not judged |
| host CPU busy (share of the run) | 0.113 | 0.116 | +1.9% | -0.0019 to 0.0062 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds | 202 | 206 | +1.9% | -3.21 to 11 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds per 1,000 transactions inside the line | 0.15 | 0.153 | +1.9% | -0.00194 to 0.00762 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| buffer pool size changes written (the knob's moves) | 0 | 2.67 |  | -4.92 to 10.3 | shown, not judged |

Every omni arm handed back to native's pool size (128 MB): yes; another writer seen: no; fail-ups: 0.
