Evidence class **S** (models of the plants, not hardware). Every organism runs native (its own controllers) and native with Omni-Compass on top (the compass law on every muscle, round 6 of `docs/REALMS_PREREGISTRATION.md`) on the same seed, the same load and the same clock. **Size** is the number of copies of the organism governed together on one clock: 1, 10, 100 and 1,000 clusters. **Runs** are paired seeds from 7000 on; 1, 10, 100 and 1,000 runs are the first N of the same set, so each block nests inside the next. Built by `tools/grid.py` from the saved receipts in `results/scale/receipts/`. How to read it: `docs/HOW_TO_READ_THE_RESULTS.md`.

- 1,000 runs at 1,000 clusters is not run: about 6,000 machine-hours, beyond the machines available.
- 100 runs at 1,000 clusters is not run yet: about 650 runner-hours (one run of the four stacked at 1,000 copies takes 2 to 3 hours); the 1-run and 10-run cells at 1,000 clusters are complete.

## Summary of the completed cells

- Cells completed: 84 of 90 (six organisms x 15 size and run cells).
- Band first held: 83 of 84. Not held in: Physics / Robotics / Autonomous, 10x, 1 run (+0.001 pp) (a single run has no interval; inside the 2% the rule allows, and held over 10, 100 and 1,000 runs).
- Every knob handed back in every completed cell: True.
- Work done: the largest cost in any completed cell is 0.007% (thermal zones held warmer have a little less margin in a heat spike; `docs/REALMS_PREREGISTRATION.md`, round 6 receipts), inside the 2% the rule allows (`DISCLOSURES.md`, section 3).
- The full receipt of each size, with the 95% interval of every number, is in `results/scale/receipts/`.
