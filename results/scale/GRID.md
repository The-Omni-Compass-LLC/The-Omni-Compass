Evidence class **S** (models of the plants, not hardware). Every organism runs native (its own controllers) and native with Omni-Compass on top (the compass law on every muscle, Omni v3, `docs/OMNI_V3.md`) on the same seed, the same load and the same clock. **Size** is the number of copies of the organism governed together on one clock: 1, 10, 100 and 1,000 clusters. **Runs** are paired seeds from 7000 on; 1, 10, 100 and 1,000 runs are the first N of the same set, so each block nests inside the next. Built by `tools/grid.py` from the saved receipts in `results/scale/receipts/`; the v1 grid and its receipts are kept in `results/scale/v1/`. How to read it: `docs/HOW_TO_READ_THE_RESULTS.md`.

- 100x: to run
- 1000x: GitHub Actions workflow `six`, run 37578946088 (Omni v3, commit 3edcfb68a6c6); the pooled receipt `six-receipts/SIX.md`, archived in `results/live/raw/run-37578946088/`.
- 1,000 runs at 1,000 clusters is not run: about 6,000 machine-hours, beyond the machines available.
- 100 runs at 1,000 clusters is not run yet: about 650 runner-hours (one run of the four stacked at 1,000 copies takes 2 to 3 hours).

## Summary of the completed cells

- Cells completed: 60 of 90 (six organisms x 15 size and run cells).
- Band first held: 60 of 60.
- Every knob handed back in every completed cell: True.
- Work done: the largest cost in any completed cell is 0.005% (thermal zones held warmer have a little less margin in a heat spike; `docs/REALMS_PREREGISTRATION.md`), inside the 2% the rule allows (`DISCLOSURES.md`, section 3).
- The full receipt of each size, with the 95% interval of every number, is in `results/scale/receipts/`.
