Evidence class **S** (simulation). Run 2026-10-01 22:26 UTC, commit `d801ec58fb29`, seeds 2000-2009 (10 paired seeds per muscle and per organism). Preregistered in `docs/REALMS_PREREGISTRATION.md` (round 2); round 1 is kept in `round1/`; harness `realms/`; every plant and its native controller in `realms/plants.py`, every number in `realms/presets.py`. The governor is the frozen `omnicompass.adapter.Governor`, unchanged, and every knob obeys the shipped nervous system (`omnicompass/nervous_system.py`) the way the live controller's organs do.

Primary outcome: work per energy, Omni against native, with its 95% interval over seeds. Guardrails: work not lower by more than 1%, share of periods in violation not higher by more than 1 percentage point. Labels by rule.

These are models. A model's energy is not a meter's, and a plant written by the same people who wrote the governor is not an independent test. What a row here can show is whether the governor's law, applied to that knob, helps or hurts the model, and where it breaks.

## By knob: what kind of authority Omni held

| Knob | Muscles | SUPERIOR WITHIN GUARDRAILS | ENERGY IMPROVEMENT WITH SERVICE TRADEOFF | NONINFERIOR / INCONCLUSIVE | NOT ESTABLISHED | WORSE | INVALID | Median work per energy |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|

| admission | 194 | 0 | 10 | 141 | 7 | 36 | 0 | +0.0% |

## Setpoint muscles: Omni against simply fixing the setpoint at the band's calm end

For 54 of 55 setpoint muscles, a fixed setpoint at the calm end of the declared band gave more work per energy than Omni moving it. On those muscles the gain is the band, not the governor. The fixed setpoint's own label (with its service guardrails) is in `MUSCLES.csv`.
