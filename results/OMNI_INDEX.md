Every measure of every test is a ratio oriented so that above 1 is better for Omni-Compass on top of native: work (more is better), speed (a lower response time), machines (fewer), energy (less). A test's index is the geometric mean of its ratios; a category is the geometric mean of its tests; the headline is the geometric mean of the real categories, each weighted the same. Modelled muscles are shown beside it, never inside it. Every number is read from the test's own result file (`tools/omni_index.py`).

## Headline: Omni-Compass on top of native, real machines: **+12.9%** (more for the same, or the same for less, across work, speed, machines and energy)

| Category | Index | Work | Speed | Machines | Energy | Tests |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Real Kubernetes (GitHub) | **+18.5%** | +6.5% | +75.0% | +1.0% | +0.2% | 11 |
| Real cloud (Azure AKS, billed) | **+7.5%** | +0.0% | +25.4% | -0.8% |  | 1 |
| Real card (NVIDIA, its own meter) | pending | | | | | the rerun on the current card controller (the 2026-10-02 run used the replaced one) |
| Modelled muscles (evidence S) | **+0.1%** | +0.0% |  |  | +0.1% | 6 |

Read: +10% in a column means 10% better for Omni-Compass in that measure (more work, a faster answer, fewer machines, less energy). The energy figure on GitHub's Kubernetes is a declared model, not a meter; Azure's machines are its own billed count.
