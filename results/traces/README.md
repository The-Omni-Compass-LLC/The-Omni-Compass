# Public demand traces, turned into load schedules

The six Kubernetes tests drive the real cluster with load schedules of our own. The schedules here are derived from
demand traces somebody else published, by a rule written before the runs (`docs/TRACES_PREREGISTRATION.md`), with
`tools/trace_schedule.py`. Each folder holds the receipt (`schedule.json`: the source, every part read with its SHA-256,
the counts, the raw levels, the stepped schedule, the rule) and the one line the workflow takes (`LOAD_STEPS.txt`).
Anyone can re-derive a folder with the tool; the parts are public and the rule is deterministic.

| Folder | Source | What is counted | Schedule |
|---|---|---|---|
| `google2011/` | Google cluster-usage traces 2011 (`clusterdata-2011-2`, `job_events`), the trace's first day | jobs submitted an hour, 24 hours | 24 steps of 108 s, load generators 1 to 8 by min and max, one step a bin |

The parts themselves (about 0.8 MB each) are not kept here; the tool downloads them into a cache and records their
SHA-256 in the receipt.
