CPU work 30 ms per request; pod CPU limit 0.5 core native, 1 conveyed. GPU as tools/gpu_physics_sim.py. Baseline from 3 native runs on other seeds.
Lock settings: speed_gain 0.01, lock_margin 0.08, lock_step 0.02, lock_window_s 60.0, lock_floor 0.5, interval 2.0
Every number comes from the model in this file and tools/gpu_physics_sim.py, not from a meter.

### Card model gamma 3, 5 paired repetitions

#### CPU muscle only (speed handed to the customer)

#### CPU muscle + GPU speed lock (speed spent on watts)
