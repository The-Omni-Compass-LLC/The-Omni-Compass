GPU NVIDIA A10, driver 580.105.08, persistence mode Enabled, start power limit 150.00 W, workload tools/gpu_workload.py (seeded fp16 matmul request stream).
10 repetitions, order rotated, 600.0 s per arm plus 30.0 s drain, 60.0 s idle before each arm.

Phase: **confirm**. Omni frozen at commit c908054053e9; file hashes in FREEZE.json, rechecked at the end.

## Verdict on the preregistered question

Work per energy under Omni against native: 50.79 -> 52.62 served requests per kJ, difference +1.824 (95% interval +1.355 to +2.293).
Guardrails: requests served held (not below -1%), 95th-percentile response time FAILED (not above +10%), requests not served held (not above +1% of native served).
Observation (watch against native) on the same outcome: better, not proven. Authority (omni against watch): better, proven.
**Result, by rule: ENERGY IMPROVEMENT WITH SERVICE TRADEOFF.**

## Representation fidelity (the engine's projection against the telemetry at the next decision)

R_int: weighted root-mean-square of h(z next) − F_h(h(z), u) over E, U, I_U, S, B (weights 1). Directional accuracy: the share of movements the projection called in the right direction, movements under 0.01 excluded.

## Credit per write (against native at the same moments of the same request stream)

Each write owns the interval until the next write. Joules and requests finished in it, Omni governing minus native; the intervals tile the arm, so the credits add up. The decider is the rule that set the written limit (engine, a floor, the busy gate, a reflex, heat, the speed lock).

| Decided by | Writes | Seconds owned | GPU joules vs native | Requests finished vs native |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| bowl | 435 | 1676 | -2.394e+04 | -992 |
| fail_up | 317 | 4494 | +1660 | +994 |

## The control

- Writes executed (power limit and clock ceiling): Native 0, Omni watches only 0, Omni governs 2144.
- Every arm ended at the start limit.
- Energy is the device's own power.draw integrated over time; no number here is modelled.
