gym-pybullet-drones (University of Toronto) integrates every Crazyflie 2.x quadrotor and flies it with the position controller it ships with; that autopilot at the planner's cruise is native. Omni sits on top of it on one knob, the cruise override, inside the autopilot's own limits, spending tracking slack as speed (`docs/SWARM_PREREGISTRATION.md`). Energy is a declared model from the simulator's own motor constants, the same in both arms, with the avionics draw charged over the whole fleet window. Three separate GitHub runs on the same frozen engine: PyBullet reproduces to about one part in a thousand across GitHub's machines (disclosed in the preregistration's amendment 1, made after the first three runs were seen), so a gauge reads **confirmed better** or **confirmed WORSE** when all three runs reproduce to that tolerance and give the same sign, **same** under one part in a million, and **the runs differ** when they do not reproduce. A cell whose paired physics trial found a faster mission no cheaper, or not inside the safe tracking error, is listed as nothing for Omni to move; a cell with a collision in either arm is void. Every row is shown, losses included.

## Cells where the paired trial left the cruise native: nothing for Omni to move

In native mode, before the counted missions, one mission at the planner's cruise and one at 1.25 x showed a faster mission no cheaper on the simulator's own figures, or not inside the safe tracking error, so Omni left the cruise at the planner's and both arms are the same.

| Cell | Energy a mission at the planner's cruise (J) | At the trial speed (J) | Reproduced over A, B, C |
