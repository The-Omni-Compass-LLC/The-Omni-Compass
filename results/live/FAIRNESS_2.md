# The fairness test, run again under the amendment of 2026-10-03 evening, 10 paired repetitions

Source: GitHub Actions workflow `benchmark-reps` (`two_app` 1, arms native / omni / compass, order rotated, 900 measured
seconds per arm, open-loop load, the neighbour's load 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0 generators), run 37162458834, commit `199f350`,
2026-10-04, job `aggregate` (job 111327654178). Transcribed from the job's printed receipt; artifact `live-reps` (zip
SHA-256 `73bb69ca72e6fec291e184aed577efde60194719a4628c6a44b7aeef36d35451`). Under the amendment only php-apache's HPA
(the service the probe measures, `--sensed default/php-apache`) is moved; the neighbour's stays at the operator's
target. Evidence class **L**.

**Result.** **The compass law's failure problem is gone:** php-apache's failed requests 2.91% against native's
3.38% (−14.0%, not significant; first run +26.0%, significant), pending pods −10.5% (first run +65.2%). **The
neighbour is unharmed** under both laws (no row significant). With the neighbour's HPA left to the operator, the compass
law's response-time gains in this test are no longer significant. **Still worse under both laws: the mean pod start
wait, +1.1 s with the compass law (1.99 to 3.09 s) and +1.7 s with the allocation law.** By the one rule neither arm is
labelled better while that row stands. The allocation law: response times −35% to −45%, time over the line −39%, on
9.1% fewer machines in service.
