Source: GitHub Actions workflow `big-organism`, run 37359820055 (the tower: one rented Azure machine per repetition, eastus, `Standard_D8as_v4`, 2,880 s window, commit `a004a8f`, Omni v1 for everything but the power grid) and workflow `big-organism-detached`, collection run 37575930111 (the four stacked: one rented machine, westus3, `Standard_D8as_v7`, three repetitions in turn under nohup, 2,880 s window, commit `f162ce8`, Omni v1; the machine collected and deleted when all three had finished); raw files under `results/live/raw/run-37359820055/` and `results/live/raw/run-37575930111/`. A fresh six-worker kind cluster per arm, the organism at 1,000 copies with the real cluster inside. Made by `tools/six_kube_report.py` from both. The stack's compass arm ended 300 to 615 s after its 2,880 s window in every repetition (native 14 s): marked OFF THE CLOCK; the v3 stack runs with a 10,800 s window for that reason.


Each organism runs on the measured window's clock with the cluster as one more muscle (`tools/run_kil.py`): its own compute demand drives the load generator, the cluster's watts are its heat and load. Native: the stacks' own controllers and Kubernetes alone. Omni: the compass law on every simulated muscle and the live controller on the cluster, handed back at 90% of the window. Cluster rows are measured on the real cluster (energy is the declared power model; the bill, where present, is Azure's own count of machines). Organism rows are models (evidence S).

How to read it: every change is omni against native (omni is Omni-Compass on top of native), and the Reading column says in words whether it is better or worse. Lower is better for response times, time over the line, failed requests, pods started, replicas, machines, energy and the bill (less spent). Higher is better for the organism's work and work per energy. A change whose interval crosses zero is marked inside the noise. The organism must keep the window's clock: the row "organism behind its window" says how long after the window its last step ended (0 is on the clock), and a repetition where either arm ended more than 5% of the window late is marked OFF THE CLOCK in the organism's line, because its last steps saw a cluster whose load schedule had already ended.

## Each organism: omni against native, paired by repetition

### The whole tower, every muscle once, 1,000 copies: better on 6, worse on 1 (organism work), inside the noise on 5; OFF THE CLOCK in 1 of 3 repetitions (the organism ended up to 2,392 s after its window: the machine could not step this many muscles in time, and the cell's last steps saw a cluster at rest)

3 paired repetitions.
