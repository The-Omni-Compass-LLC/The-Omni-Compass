# Repeated live runs on kind, set 29: native, Omni-Compass on top with the engine's allocation law, and with the compass law and the verdict, the controller reading through one kubectl proxy, 10 paired repetitions

Source: GitHub Actions workflow `benchmark-reps`, run 37094338955, commit `a3721cc`, 2026-10-03, job `aggregate`
(job 111130515923, `python tools/live_reps.py reps`), fixed-rate load (equal work in every arm), 900 measured seconds
per arm. Transcribed from the job's printed receipt; the run's artifact `live-reps` (zip SHA-256
`9ec964ec39340d8c493f99627d99425bacf8452bd5ac3d7ed7caa69bb8e3b904`) holds the same table. Evidence class **L** (real
Kubernetes software on kind; energy is a declared model, not a meter: every worker stays powered in every arm).

What changed from set 28: one thing, written before the run (`docs/K8S_COMPASS_PREREGISTRATION.md`, set 29). The
controller reads through one `kubectl proxy` started once, so a read is a local HTTP request instead of a new kubectl
process. Same arms, load, duration and outcomes.

**Label by the preregistered rule:** total CPU including Omni-Compass's own no more than 2% above native. Compass law with
the verdict: **−4.7%** (−0.071 to −0.017 cores), **passes, and significantly lower**. Allocation law: −7.7%, passes.
Omni-Compass's own CPU fell from 0.063 cores in set 28 to 0.011 (compass) and from 0.068 to 0.018 (allocation law). No
measure in either arm is significantly worse than native.
