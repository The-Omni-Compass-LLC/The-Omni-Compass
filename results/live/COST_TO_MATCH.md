# The cost to match on kind: native, native tuned harder by its operator (HPA target 40, 30, 20), and native with Omni-Compass on top (the allocation law; the compass law with the verdict), 10 paired repetitions

Source: GitHub Actions workflow `benchmark-reps`, run 37094493912, commit `3866266`, 2026-10-03, job `aggregate`
(job 111140097802, `python tools/live_reps.py reps`), fixed-rate load (equal work in every arm), 900 measured seconds
per arm, arms rotated in each repetition. Transcribed from the job's printed receipt; the run's artifact `live-reps`
(zip SHA-256 `9bd1b4a41a23917d1a9e167f1b6ddfaafd76f82dbcd6c6d28a0d9042c0b6408d`) holds the same tables. Evidence class
**L** (real Kubernetes software on kind; energy is a declared model, not a meter). Written before the run:
`docs/K8S_COMPASS_PREREGISTRATION.md`, the cost to match.

**The answer.** No native setting tried reached Omni-Compass's response time. Tuned all the way to HPA target 20
(9.86 pods against native's 8.52), native's p95 is 346.6 ms; with Omni-Compass on top it is 123.5 ms (compass law, 8.29
pods, fewer machines) and 149.4 ms (allocation law, 6.48 pods, 4.13 machines). Tuning the autoscaler buys a native
cluster almost nothing; Omni-Compass on top cuts the p95 by about two thirds with fewer pods and fewer machines.

The receipt printed "nan" for the tuned arms' CPU including Omni-Compass's own: those arms run no Omni process, so
their own CPU is 0 and the column equals their CPU used (0.9728, 0.9596, 0.9567). `tools/live_reps.py` now counts it so.

## The cost to match

| Arm | p95 (ms) | p99 (ms) | HPA replicas | CPU used incl. Omni's own (cores) | Machines in service |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Native | 360.9 | 594.4 | 8.521 | 0.971 | 6 |
| Native tuned, HPA target 40 | 350.5 | 584.7 | 9.184 | 0.9728 | 6 |
| Native tuned, HPA target 30 | 348.9 | 546.7 | 9.733 | 0.9596 | 6 |
| Native tuned, HPA target 20 | 346.6 | 570.1 | 9.86 | 0.9567 | 6 |
| Omni on top | 149.4 | 220.6 | 6.484 | 0.9118 | 4.131 |
| Omni on top, compass law | 123.5 | 163.1 | 8.29 | 0.9332 | 5.797 |

- Omni on top, compass law (p95 123.5 ms): no native setting tried reached it; the lowest native p95 is 346.6 ms (Native tuned, HPA target 20).
- Omni on top (p95 149.4 ms): no native setting tried reached it; the lowest native p95 is 346.6 ms (Native tuned, HPA target 20).

Omni's own CPU is the controller's own cost, counted in the next row; it is the only row where native is 0 by
construction. No measure in either Omni-Compass arm is significantly worse than native.
