Run: benchmark-reps 36356742965, commit 40c95af (two arms; prefer-not idle mark, conveyed CPU, the promise in queue
terms, machines empty one at a time, pod reflex with S and R from the same window). Five paired repetitions, 15
minutes each, kind with 1 control plane and 6 workers.

A change is significant when its paired 95% interval excludes zero. Lower response time is better.

## What the trail shows (repetition 1)

**Pods not yet running.** Every one of them is a pod start native never makes.
- **My pod reflex** raised the replica floor to 10 and released it 11 times, plus three smaller floors, in one run:
  "floor 10 (queue busy 0.47 vs promise 0.20, R 156 ms, S 83 ms)" then "release floor 10 -> 1".
- **The HPA target** I held moved 278% → 185% → 138% → 82% → 50% as the pods' conveyed limits changed with how many
  shared a machine.
- Each raise, and each lower target, made the autoscaler start pods. Each start is seconds of a pod not yet running.

**What I do about it (set 18).**
- The autoscaler alone makes and removes pods. My pod reflex gauges the queue and writes nothing.
- The target I hold uses the CPU each pod is guaranteed across the machines in service, so it moves only when a
  machine idles or wakes.
