# The second amendment (a raise waits for a steady demand): capacity, fairness and fault tests, 10 paired repetitions each

Commit `5d2e238`, 2026-10-04, GitHub Actions workflow `benchmark-reps`, arms native / omni / bowl, order rotated,
open-loop load. Transcribed from each run's `aggregate` job; each run's artifact `live-reps` holds the same tables.
Design: `docs/K8S_BOWL_PREREGISTRATION.md`, "The pod record, and the second amendment". Evidence class **L**.

| Test | Run | Aggregate job | `live-reps` zip SHA-256 |
|---|---|---|---|
| capacity (`load_steps` 1 to 8, 1,600 s) | 37176746021 | 111374050394 | `dbe08676ebd0bc8837db684b4ac9db1c4a7c209b6bd87eed43ecd18caaed8d2b` |
| fairness (`two_app` 1, 900 s) | 37176747383 | 111369225045 | `ee9f8c8ba8e023b3190e6926cc46138fb6dff981d4338734fb566000b313f969` |
| faults (`faults` 1, 900 s) | 37176748773 | 111369149841 | `ce683bb91c659e450b937c0e27879a99bc2b230847d6bffb90641b8a14f10967` |

**Result.**

- **Capacity: no measure significantly worse under either law.** The bowl law served 24.6 requests a second within
  the line against native's 17.4, **+41.4% (+5.4 to +9.0)**; the allocation law **25.2, +44.8% (+4.9 to +10.7)** (it
  served +0.0% before the amendment). Pods started with the bowl law 5.7 against 4.1, interval −0.64 to +3.84, no
  longer significant (before +34.2%, significant); with the allocation law 3.4, −17.1%.
- **Faults: no measure significantly worse under either law.** Recovery faster from every fault in both arms.
- **Fairness: the bowl law, no measure significantly worse for either application.** The allocation law cut
  php-apache's response times by a third and its failures by 37%, and **the neighbour's failed requests rose from
  13.80% to 14.54% (+0.19 to +1.28 points), significant**: the allocation law conveys idle CPU to the service it
  senses, and on machines shared with a surging neighbour that CPU is the neighbour's headroom. The allocation law is
  not labelled better in the fairness test; the bowl law, the law carried forward, is clean in all three.
