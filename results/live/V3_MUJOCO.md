MuJoCo (Google DeepMind) integrates each arm; MuJoCo Menagerie supplies the robot as its maker describes it, with the position servos it ships with as native. Omni sits on top of that servo on one knob, the speed override, inside the task's takt (`docs/ROBOTICS_PREREGISTRATION.md`). Energy is a declared model from MuJoCo's own torques and velocities, the same in both arms, with the standing draw charged for the whole takt. Three separate GitHub runs on the same frozen engine: MuJoCo is deterministic, so a gauge reads **confirmed better** or **confirmed WORSE** when all three runs give the same sign, **same** under one part in a million, and **the runs differ** when they do not reproduce. A robot whose paired physics trial found a slower cycle no cheaper is listed as nothing for Omni to move. Every row is shown, losses included.

## Robots where the paired trial left the override native: nothing for Omni to move

In native mode, before the counted cycles, one cycle at full speed and one at override 0.8 showed a slower cycle no cheaper on the robot's own figures (the gravity-holding torque is paid for longer), so Omni left the override at 1.0 and both arms are the same. Reproduced over A, B, C is whether the three runs agree on every gauge.

| Robot | Full-speed cycle (J, motion) | Override 0.8 cycle (J, motion) | Reproduced over A, B, C |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| kuka_iiwa_14 | 3157.3 | 3757.3 | yes |
| universal_robots_ur5e | 189.9 | 210.5 | yes |
