GitHub Actions run 37262789900, the live controller frozen at rules 1-8 (commit 353903683009; amendment 9, the brake at the idle floor, could not fire in this run: the service was never at its floor). Raw files with their SHA-256 sums: `results/live/raw/run-37262789900/`. Rebuilt with `python3 tools/live_reps.py` on those files.


## All columns, mean over repetitions

| response time (ms), mean | 268.5 | 150.7 |
| response time (ms), 95th percentile | 741.1 | 273.1 |
| response time (ms), 99th percentile | 2544 | 2031 |
| time over the response line (% of samples) | 17.88 | 10.61 |
| failed requests (%) | 9.856 | 8.632 |
| pods with no machine to take them (unschedulable) | 0 | 0 |
| time pods had no machine to take them, pod-minutes | 0 | 0 |
| pending pods in a 15 s snapshot, pod-minutes (a pod being started counts too: shown, not judged) | 0.3683 | 0.48 |

| CPU used (cores), mean | 2.37 | 2.314 |
| Omni's own CPU (cores), mean | 0 | 0.00858 |
| CPU used with Omni's own (cores), mean | 2.37 | 2.322 |
| energy per core-hour (Wh, the 25 W standby model; a ratio over CPU used: shown, not judged) | 313.8 | 320 |
| HPA replicas, mean | 9.491 | 9.075 |
| pods started | 4.5 | 4.9 |
| pod start wait, total (s) | 14.6 | 15.5 |
| pod start wait, mean (s) | 2.69 | 2.781 |

| host cores (the real machine under kind) | 4 | 4 |

**Energy on kind is a declared model, not a meter.** Every worker stays powered and Ready in every arm; the first
energy row counts a parked worker at its full idle power, which is what kind does. The second counts it at the
declared standby power, which needs a node autoscaler that really removes the machine; this run has none.

## The capacity test: the same machines, the load rising step by step

Each step adds one load generator (6 requests a second each). A run's capacity is the highest step at which no more than 5% of response samples are over the line or failed (and every lower step held too), the first 30 s of each step left to settle. Paired over the repetitions; higher is more work from the same machines.

| Arm | Capacity (requests a second), mean | Change against native | 95% interval of the difference (requests a second) | Repetitions |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| native | 21.6 |  |  | 10 |
| compass | 30.6 | +41.7% | +6.7 to +11.3 | 10 |
