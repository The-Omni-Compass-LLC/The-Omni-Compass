Source: GitHub Actions workflow `benchmark-reps`, run 37058424766, commit `e7f920d`, 2026-10-02, job `aggregate`
(`python tools/live_reps.py reps`), fixed-rate load (equal work in every arm), 900 measured seconds per arm. Transcribed
from the job's printed receipt; the run's artifact `live-reps` holds the same table. Evidence class **L** (real
Kubernetes software on kind; energy is a declared model, not a meter: every worker stays powered in every arm).

### B: the engine's allocation law (`--law governor`) against native

**Label of the compass arm by the preregistered rule** (`docs/K8S_COMPASS_PREREGISTRATION.md`): p95 not worse (the whole
interval below 0), failed requests not higher, machines in service down with the whole interval below 0:
**better on machines within the band**.
