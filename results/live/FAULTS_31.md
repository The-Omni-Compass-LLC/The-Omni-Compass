# The fault test on kind, set 31 F: native, Omni-Compass on top with the allocation law, and with the compass law and the verdict, past the wall from a blind sense or a lost machine the operator's own HPA target, 10 paired repetitions

Source: GitHub Actions workflow `benchmark-reps` with `faults: 1`, run 37110005322, commit `0a38e76`, 2026-10-03, job `aggregate`
(job 111175082422, `python tools/live_reps.py reps`), fixed-rate load, 900 measured seconds per arm. Transcribed from the job's
printed receipt; the run's artifact `live-reps` (zip SHA-256 `fdba8b3b02d9c52f4a9357cff569e8cf3c0f7357a471b78af844106f3ea0442c`) holds the same tables.
Evidence class **L** (real Kubernetes software on kind; energy is a declared model, not a meter).

**The pods are closed.** With the compass law, HPA replicas under faults **−1.1%** (not significant; first run +8.2%, set 30 F +5.6%). No measure in either arm is significantly worse than native. Recovery is faster than native from every fault; the compass law's machine-down recovery −49%. The 99th percentile, alone among the response rows, reads higher in both arms (+10.2%, +30.5%) with intervals far across zero (−754 to +979 ms, −361 to +1,030 ms): in a run with faults it is set by a few seconds around each fault and swings by more than its own size between repetitions; the 95th percentile, the mean and the time over the line are all lower.
