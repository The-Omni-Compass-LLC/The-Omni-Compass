Source: GitHub Actions workflow `six-kube`, run 37359815637, commit `a004a8f` (Omni v1 for everything but the power grid: 37 of 38 v1 files, the power-grid runner not yet written, `tools/omni_version.py --commit a004a8f`), 2026-10-05/06; raw files under `results/live/raw/run-37359815637/`; 98 of 100 cells (1, 10 and 100 copies of all six organisms, 1,000 copies of the four realms and the tower; the two 1,000-copy stack cells cut off by GitHub's six-hour job limit). Made by `tools/six_kube_report.py`.


Each organism runs on the measured window's clock with the cluster as one more muscle (`tools/run_kil.py`): its own compute demand drives the load generator, the cluster's watts are its heat and load. Native: the stacks' own controllers and Kubernetes alone. Omni: the compass law on every simulated muscle and the live controller on the cluster, handed back at 90% of the window. Cluster rows are measured on the real cluster (energy is the declared power model; the bill, where present, is Azure's own count of machines). Organism rows are models (evidence S).

How to read it: every change is omni against native (omni is Omni-Compass on top of native), and the Reading column says in words whether it is better or worse. Lower is better for response times, time over the line, failed requests, pods started, replicas, machines, energy and the bill (less spent). Higher is better for the organism's work and work per energy. A change whose interval crosses zero is marked inside the noise. The organism must keep the window's clock: the row "organism behind its window" says how long after the window its last step ended (0 is on the clock), and a repetition where either arm ended more than 5% of the window late is marked OFF THE CLOCK in the organism's line, because its last steps saw a cluster whose load schedule had already ended.
