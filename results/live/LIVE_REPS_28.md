# Repeated live runs on kind, set 28: native, Omni-Compass on top with the engine's allocation law, and with the compass law and the verdict, 10 paired repetitions

Source: GitHub Actions workflow `benchmark-reps`, run 37087620193, commit `24666d7`, 2026-10-03, job `aggregate`
(job 111111314584, `python tools/live_reps.py reps`), fixed-rate load (equal work in every arm), 900 measured seconds
per arm. Transcribed from the job's printed receipt; the run's artifact `live-reps` (zip SHA-256
`ca308239ad469e9429749ff6b976c46c2320922db99cc4b313f9200ecc4103fd`) holds the same table. Evidence class **L** (real
Kubernetes software on kind; energy is a declared model, not a meter: every worker stays powered in every arm).

The compass arm gives a machine back only where the verdict (`omnicompass/verdict.py`, stepwise) measures responses at
most 2% slower without it (`docs/K8S_COMPASS_PREREGISTRATION.md`, the verdict in the live controller).
