Source: GitHub Actions workflow `benchmark-reps` (`load_steps` 1 to 8, 200 s a step, 1,600 measured seconds per arm,
arms native / omni / compass, order rotated, open-loop load), run 37162457542, commit `199f350`, 2026-10-04, job
`aggregate` (job 111332953338, `python tools/live_reps.py reps`). Transcribed from the job's printed receipt; the run's
artifact `live-reps` (zip SHA-256 `3fe93f2d5ef23a44a3442fcfd24f5c5b14501ca9711c3fab3b53440e4d578d7b`) holds the same
tables. Design: `docs/K8S_COMPASS_PREREGISTRATION.md`, "The capacity test" and its amendment. Evidence class **L**.

**Result.** With the compass law on top, the same six machines served **24.6 requests a second within the line against
native's 16.2: +51.9%, 95% interval of the paired difference +6.2 to +10.6 requests a second.** The first run
(`CAPACITY.md`, commit `422d60c`) measured the same paired difference, +8.4 requests a second, on runners where native
served 24.6; GitHub's runners were slower this time for every arm (native's failures 7.3% against 3.5%), the gap the
same. Response times −28% to −56%, time over the line −49%, failed requests −9.6%, mean HPA replicas −10.7%, all
significant. **Still worse: pods started, 5.1 against 3.8 (+34.2%, interval +0.29 to +2.31)**; the amendment's hold
on a growing demand did not remove it (first run +30.4%). Read with the replicas 10.7% lower, the extra starts are
pods started earlier on a rising load, the mechanism of the added capacity; it is reported here as measured and the
compass arm is not labelled better by the one rule while it stands. The allocation law: capacity unchanged (+0.0%), pods
started +76.3%.

Energy on kind is a declared model, not a meter (see `CAPACITY.md`).
