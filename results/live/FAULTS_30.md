# The fault test on kind, re-run (set 30 F): native, Omni-Compass on top with the allocation law, and with the compass law and the verdict, the operator's HPA target handed back at once when a fault is over, 10 paired repetitions

Source: GitHub Actions workflow `benchmark-reps` with `faults: 1`, run 37105046042, commit `acc1c4e`, 2026-10-03, job
`aggregate` (job 111161043506, `python tools/live_reps.py reps`), fixed-rate load, 900 measured seconds per arm.
Transcribed from the job's printed receipt; the run's artifact `live-reps` (zip SHA-256
`f76ab0b2fff54538de8e04a0d21b3fead4ede66e2eea095dc9cc048e6b5669e6`) holds the same tables. Evidence class **L**. The
same four faults at the same moments as the first run (`results/live/FAULTS.md`).

**Against the first run.** Recovery is faster than native from every fault in both arms. With the compass law, HPA
replicas fell from +8.2% to **+5.6%** (+0.19 to +0.78 pods, significant): still worse, with CPU and machines unchanged and
no energy saved, so still outside the one rule (`DISCLOSURES.md`, section 3). It is not closed by this change; the next
change and its re-run are recorded in `docs/K8S_COMPASS_PREREGISTRATION.md`.
