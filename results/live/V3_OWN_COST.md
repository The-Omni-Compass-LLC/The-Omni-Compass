Omni-Compass's own CPU: the seconds its process and every command it ran spent on the CPU over the measured window, as a share of one core, from the `overhead` record every omni arm's audit carries (`omni_controller/controller.py`, written at exit), with the host's core count beside it. Native runs no governor: its cost is zero by construction. The organisms are the six with the real cluster inside (`tools/run_kil.py`); the governor's cost is the cost of governing the real cluster, which does not grow with the organism around it. Each run is shown under the engine its commit carries, and nothing is read across engines (`docs/ROBUSTNESS_PREREGISTRATION.md`, scenario 3). Shown, not judged.
