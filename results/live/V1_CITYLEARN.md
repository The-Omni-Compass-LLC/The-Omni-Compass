# CityLearn, every district: the A/B/C confirmation (Omni v1)

CityLearn (University of Texas at Austin) is an independent, deterministic simulator of real buildings with its own controller (BasicRBC) and its own scores; every score reads lower is better. Native is that controller; omni is the same controller with the compass law on top of its electric battery commands only (`tools/run_citylearn.py`). The same districts ran three times as separate GitHub runs on the same frozen engine. Because the simulator is deterministic, the runs must reproduce each other: a score reads **confirmed better** or **confirmed WORSE** when all three runs give the same sign, **same** when the change is under one part in a million, and **the runs differ** when they do not reproduce, which is a finding about the simulator or the harness and is said so. A district with no electric battery gets nothing from Omni (a water tank stays native), so any native/omni difference in it is CityLearn's own run-to-run variation, never an Omni result. Every row is shown, losses included.

## Districts with no electric battery: nothing for Omni to move

The runner changes only `electrical_storage` commands, so in these districts omni applied nothing. Any difference between the arms is CityLearn's own run-to-run variation and says nothing about Omni; where the two arms agree, the simulator is deterministic there.

| District | Buildings | Water tanks (native) | Scores where native and omni differ in A | Reproduced over A, B, C |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| baeda_3dem | 4 | 7 | none | yes |
| quebec_neighborhood_with_demand_response_set_points | 20 | 0 | time uncomfortable -0.86% | no |
| quebec_neighborhood_without_demand_response_set_points | 20 | 0 | time uncomfortable +0.25% | no |

## Districts CityLearn cannot run with its own controller

The same for native and omni; listed, never dropped.
