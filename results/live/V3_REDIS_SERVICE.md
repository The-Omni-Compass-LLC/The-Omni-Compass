# Redis, a cache's operator-set memory ceiling: the A/B/C confirmation

Redis as shipped with the operator's memory ceiling (64 MB, allkeys-lru) is native; omni is the compass law on the ceiling through Redis's own console inside [16, 512] MB, holding the application's own request latency at 40% of the 2 ms line, a hit inside and a miss with its store trip outside (`docs/REDIS_PREREGISTRATION.md`). Each run holds three paired repetitions; the paired difference's 95% interval within a run, and the same sign with every interval clear of zero across the three runs, make a reading **confirmed better** or **confirmed WORSE**; a run whose interval includes zero reads **no difference beyond the noise** (with the count of such runs); clear runs pointing different ways read **the runs disagree**. Failed requests: any increase in any run is WORSE. Memory held is the resource; the host's CPU-seconds, the compass's own cost included, are measured on GitHub's shared runner, and no energy is claimed beyond them. The tuning workload is shown and not counted. Every row is shown, losses included.

The brain's own verdict on the knob in the omni arms, one trial at a time on the stack itself (the objective: service): run A: acting: 56 to 72 (19 trials, 2 allowed, 1 refused); acting: 56 to 72 (15 trials, 2 allowed, 0 refused); acting: 56 to 64 (18 trials, 1 allowed, 0 refused); run B: acting: 56 to 72 (16 trials, 2 allowed, 1 refused); acting: 56 to 72 (19 trials, 2 allowed, 0 refused); acting: 56 to 72 (14 trials, 2 allowed, 1 refused); run C: acting: 56 to 80 (17 trials, 3 allowed, 1 refused); acting: 48 to 72 (17 trials, 3 allowed, 0 refused); acting: 56 to 80 (21 trials, 3 allowed, 0 refused).
