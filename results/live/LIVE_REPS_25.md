Source: GitHub Actions workflow `benchmark-reps`, run 37057508359, commit `6fa7a97`, 2026-10-02, job `aggregate`
(`python tools/live_reps.py reps`), fixed-rate load (equal work in every arm), 900 measured seconds per arm. Transcribed
from the job's printed receipt; the run's artifact `live-reps` holds the same table. Evidence class **L** (real
Kubernetes software on kind; energy is a declared model, not a meter: every worker stays powered in every arm).

| energy, parked workers still on at idle power (Wh, declared model) | 160.3 | 159.7 | -0.4% | -1.301 to -0.02267 | yes, better |

| utilisation (used / allocatable) | 0.04038 | 0.05504 | +36.3% | +0.01047 to +0.01884 | yes, more |
| CPU used (cores), mean | 0.9692 | 0.8967 | -7.5% | -0.0893 to -0.05579 | yes, less |
