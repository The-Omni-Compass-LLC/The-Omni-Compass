| node-hours | 1.513 | 1.514 |
| energy, parked workers still on at idle power (Wh, declared model) | 172.1 | 171.9 |
| energy, parked workers at 25 W standby (Wh, declared model; kind never does this) | 172.1 | 171.9 |
| response time (ms), mean | 514.5 | 437.4 |
| response time (ms), 95th percentile | 2326 | 1975 |

| time over the response line (% of samples) | 22.71 | 21 |
| failed requests (%) | 3.477 | 3.035 |
| pending pods, pod-minutes | 1.355 | 1.208 |
| utilisation (used / allocatable) | 0.09582 | 0.09451 |

| host cores (the real machine under kind) | 4 | 4 |
| second app: response time (ms), 95th percentile | 263 | 259.8 |

**Energy on kind is a declared model, not a meter.** Every worker stays powered and Ready in every arm; the first
energy row counts a parked worker at its full idle power, which is what kind does. The second counts it at the
declared standby power, which needs a node autoscaler that really removes the machine; this run has none.

## omni (compass law): Omni-Compass on top of native, push and pull on the HPA target and the node pool vs native, 10 paired repetitions
