Run: benchmark-reps 36309238960 on commit 5ae3f01 (set 8, run 36308670935, was cancelled before it finished;
this set replaces it). Aggregated with `tools/live_reps.py`.

Changes since set 7:
- Power and heat no longer veto a machine release.
- A released worker counts as removed from the pool (0 W, as in a cloud node pool), in every arm.
- The HPA target is queue-matched.

## Reading

Machines are now released live, and energy falls 11% (B) and 18% (C). With only 5 reps, neither drop is significant.
Response time went the wrong way in both arms. This set is not a win.

## Diagnosis from the decision trails (rep 1, both arms)

- All senses were live (no blind senses after the first decision), and drift was 0.
- Every time the SLO came back clean, the next decision breached:
  - B: 414.7 -> 597.6 ms, 464.4 -> 798.4 ms, 472.6 -> 550.2 ms
  - C: 413.0 -> 663.9 ms, 405.5 -> 727.9 ms
- A clean SLO is the only state in which Omni caps pod CPU (the power-cap muscle, CFS throttling) and raises the HPA
  target. The strict arm never touches the HPA target and shows the same pattern, so the power cap is the common cause.
- Why the cap is wrong for this workload: a request-served workload's CPU-seconds are set by its arrivals. Throttling
  runs the same work later, so it saves no energy and only adds queueing wait.
- Why the HPA target raise is wrong: for a fixed load, fewer pods always means a longer M/M/c wait, so no target above
  the operator's keeps the wait. The "queue-matched" raise (70% -> 79% at 2.4 busy pods) kept the same replica count,
  so it saved nothing and spent burst headroom.

## Fix (set 10)

- `omni_controller/muscles.py`: no power cap on a request-served workload (latency sense wired). Energy comes from
  machines.
- `omni_controller/controller.py`: Omni on top may tighten the HPA target but never loosen it.
