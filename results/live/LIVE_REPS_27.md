Source: GitHub Actions workflow `benchmark-reps`, run 37071353971, commit `d46c959`, 2026-10-02, job `aggregate`
(job 111067346619, `python tools/live_reps.py reps`), fixed-rate load (equal work in every arm), 900 measured seconds
per arm. Transcribed from the job's printed receipt; the run's artifact `live-reps` (artifact 11257320626, zip SHA-256
`7bc1ad7cb199312a6fb28f00352ac57ee4f70211801d43775b3a5c3e92e15dac`) holds the same table. Evidence class **L** (real
Kubernetes software on kind; energy is a declared model, not a meter: every worker stays powered in every arm).

The compass arm here reads the service as the GPU governor does: the mean response time of the latency window between a
tenth of the SLO and the SLO, held at center 0.4; p95 at or past the SLO, a blind probe or a pending pod is past the
wall (`docs/K8S_COMPASS_PREREGISTRATION.md`, set 27).

**Energy on kind is a declared model, not a meter.** Every worker stays powered and Ready in every arm; the first
energy row counts a parked worker at its full idle power, which is what kind does. The second counts it at the
declared standby power, which needs a node autoscaler that really removes the machine; this run has none.

**Label of the compass arm by the preregistered rule** (`docs/K8S_COMPASS_PREREGISTRATION.md`): p95 not worse (the whole
interval below 0), failed requests not higher, machines in service down with the whole interval below 0:
**better on machines within the band**.
