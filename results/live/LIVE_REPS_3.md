This is the first set with the probe through the Service (NodePort via kube-proxy) and the PodDisruptionBudget, and
the first live set with the supervisory nervous system gating machine release.

## B: Omni-Compass on top vs native, 5 paired repetitions

## Reading

**Failed requests.** They are 0% in every arm. The 16-66% of sets 1-2 was the probe's hung tunnel, as diagnosed.

**Machines.** Omni-Compass kept all 6 machines in service in every repetition. Controller log: 15 of 15 decisions,
0 errors, no node-scale command.

- **The likely cause.** With a working probe, p95 sits at 430-460 ms against the 500 ms SLO declared before the run.
  Every window above 500 ms is SLO pressure. That pressure blocks machine release for the next 3 decisions and lowers
  the engine's calm.
- **Why that is odd here.** Machines are at 7% utilisation with no waiting pods. The latency comes from the
  workload's per-request compute, not from a machine shortage.
- **Why the earlier sets differed.** Sets 1-2 released machines because the hung probe produced few or no successful
  samples, so the controller saw little latency pressure. Their machine savings were therefore measured with a blinded
  latency sense and are not claimed.
- **How this will be settled.** The decision trail (p95, SLO state, calm, node authority per decision) is now printed
  in every job log. Set 4 will show which gate held.

**Everything else.** No significant difference from native on any gauge, except that C has more pending pod-minutes
(0.80 vs 0.34 pod-minutes).
