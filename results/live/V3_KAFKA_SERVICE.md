Apache Kafka as shipped (one broker, a topic of 8 partitions) with the consumer group at the operator's count is native; omni is the compass law on the consumer count inside [1, 8], holding the group's own end-to-end latency at 40% of the 500 ms line (`docs/KAFKA_PREREGISTRATION.md`). Each run holds three paired repetitions; the paired difference's 95% interval within a run, and the same sign with every interval clear of zero across the three runs, make a reading **confirmed better** or **confirmed WORSE**; a run whose interval includes zero reads **no difference beyond the noise** (with the count of such runs); clear runs pointing different ways read **the runs disagree**. Lost messages: any increase in any run is WORSE. The tuning workload is shown and not counted. Every row is shown, losses included. The host's CPU-seconds are measured on GitHub's shared runner, the compass's own cost included; no energy is claimed beyond them.

The brain's own verdict on the knob in the omni arms, one trial at a time on the stack itself (the objective: service): run A: left native (2 trials, 0 allowed, 0 refused); left native (2 trials, 0 allowed, 0 refused); left native (2 trials, 0 allowed, 0 refused); run B: left native (2 trials, 0 allowed, 0 refused); left native (2 trials, 0 allowed, 0 refused); left native (2 trials, 0 allowed, 0 refused); run C: left native (2 trials, 0 allowed, 0 refused); left native (2 trials, 0 allowed, 0 refused); left native (2 trials, 0 allowed, 0 refused).
