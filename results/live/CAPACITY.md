# The capacity test on kind: the same six machines, the load rising step by step, 10 paired repetitions

Source: GitHub Actions workflow `benchmark-reps` (`load_steps` 1 to 8, 200 s a step, 1,600 measured seconds per arm,
arms native / omni / compass, order rotated), run 37150909816, commit `422d60c`, 2026-10-03, job `aggregate` (job
111300598062, `python tools/live_reps.py reps`). Transcribed from the job's printed receipt; the run's artifact
`live-reps` (zip SHA-256 `610f44548e98e1a8d7f15918fde2ffe9a8f4e37dcb48eb5ae2cc19bddffce99e`) holds the same tables.
Design written before the run: `docs/K8S_COMPASS_PREREGISTRATION.md`, "The capacity test". Evidence class **L** (real
Kubernetes software on kind; energy is a declared model, not a meter).

**Result.** With the compass law and the verdict on top, the same six machines served **33.0 requests a second within the
line against native's 24.6: +34.1%, 95% interval of the paired difference +6.2 to +10.6 requests a second** (+25% to
+43%). Response times fell by about half at every percentile and failed requests fell 8.6%, both significant. One
measure is significantly worse: **pods started, 7.3 against 5.6 (+30.4%)**, with the allocation law 7.8 (+39.3%). The
mean HPA replicas are lower (−26.9%), so the extra starts are churn (pods removed between load steps and started again
on the next), not more pods held. By the one rule (nothing more than 2% worse) the compass arm is therefore not yet
labelled better; the cause and its correction are recorded in the preregistration, amendment of 2026-10-03 evening,
and the test is run again under it.

## Capacity

A run's capacity is the highest step at which no more than 5% of response samples are over the line or failed (and
every lower step held too), the first 30 s of each step left to settle. Each step adds one load generator (6 requests
a second).

| Arm | Capacity (requests a second), mean | Change against native | 95% interval of the difference (requests a second) | Repetitions |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| native | 24.6 |  |  | 10 |
| omni | 25.8 | +4.9% | -0.6 to +3.0 | 10 |
| compass | 33.0 | +34.1% | +6.2 to +10.6 | 10 |

Energy on kind is a declared model, not a meter: every worker stays powered and Ready in every arm; the first energy
row counts a parked worker at its full idle power, which is what kind does; the second counts it at a declared
standby power, which needs a node autoscaler that really removes the machine. This run has none.
