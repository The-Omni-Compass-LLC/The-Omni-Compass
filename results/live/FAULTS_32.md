# The fault test on kind, set 32 F: run again under the amendment of 2026-10-03 evening, 10 paired repetitions

Source: GitHub Actions workflow `benchmark-reps` (`faults` 1, arms native / omni / bowl, order rotated, 900 measured
seconds per arm, open-loop load), run 37162459956, commit `199f350`, 2026-10-04, job `aggregate` (job 111327606574).
Transcribed from the job's printed receipt; artifact `live-reps` (zip SHA-256
`6ee05b4889a9690ab3252488e5917f545a651a079edcf44ae2a6201e415c464d`). The same four faults at the same moments of every
arm (`scripts/kind_faults.sh`). Evidence class **L**.

**Result. No measure is significantly worse than native under either law.** The amendment leaves the fault behaviour
intact (set 31 F, `FAULTS_31.md`): the bowl law recovers from a lost machine 58% faster, starts 34% fewer pods, and
cuts the 95th percentile by 61%, failed requests by 12.9% and time over the line by 27.6%. The 99th percentile reads
higher in both arms with intervals far across zero, as in set 31 F.
