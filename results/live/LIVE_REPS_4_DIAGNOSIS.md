All 15 runs succeeded. The aggregate job failed before it got a runner (no steps ran), so this set has no aggregate
table. Its purpose was the decision trail, printed in each job log.

**Decision trail, Omni-on-top run 1** (job 108541805932), 15 decisions:

```

## Two gates held the machines
**1. SLO clean.** It was false in 13 of 15 decisions.
- p95 spiked to 695-707 ms at each load-generator step, while php-apache saturated until the HPA added pods.
- Each breach blocks release for the next 3 decisions.

**2. Calm.** It never passed 0.654, and the node organ's threshold is 0.7.
- An offline replay decomposes calm and finds it capped by basin health: h = (U - 0.85) / 0.15.
- The latency pressure fed into the shared engine state held U at about 0.946 or below.

## Diagnosis
The latency is pod-level: workers ran at about 7% utilisation and no pod was waiting for a place. Holding machines
cannot cure it, but the single shared state charged it to every organ.

## Mechanism change (commit after cdc8cd9), judged by live set 5
The machine organ now has its own engine view and a release gate
(`omnicompass/nervous_system.node_release_gate`, `tests/test_node_release_gate.py`).

**Its own engine view.**
- It is fed with machine-attributable pressure only: pods waiting for a place.
- It must grant contraction by its own calm, stress and security gates.

**Pods-first coordination** (the rule benchmarked in simulation). There is no release:
- while any HPA is scaling up;
- while latency is breached now.

**Headroom proof.**
- Nothing is pending.
- After the release, the remaining machines run at or below the engine's own utilisation target: used / ((n - 1) per
  node) <= rho.

**Pace.** At most one machine per decision.

Every decision records the gate's reason in the audit, and the trail prints it.
