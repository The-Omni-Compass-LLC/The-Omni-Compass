# Repeated live runs on kind, set 31: native, Omni-Compass on top with the allocation law, and with the compass law and the verdict (the operator's HPA target at once when a fault is over; fail up from a blind sense or a lost machine is the operator's own target), 10 paired repetitions

(job 111175240710, `python tools/live_reps.py reps`), fixed-rate load, 900 measured seconds per arm. Transcribed from the job's
printed receipt; the run's artifact `live-reps` (zip SHA-256 `7423ff466b76abb09aab03ff3f54e0f8c7616bdaf276f0f40af29619a48606f2`) holds the same tables.
Evidence class **L** (real Kubernetes software on kind; energy is a declared model, not a meter).

**No measure in either arm is significantly worse than native.** Total CPU including Omni-Compass's own: compass −6.1%, allocation law −6.6%.
