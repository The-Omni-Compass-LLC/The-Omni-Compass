# sysbench on MySQL, a database's operator-set buffer pool: the A/B/C confirmation

MySQL as Ubuntu ships it with the operator's InnoDB buffer pool (512 MB) is native; omni is the compass law on the pool size through the server's own console inside [128, 2,048] MB in chunks of 128 MB, holding the server's own mean statement latency at 40% of the 0.6 ms statement line (`docs/MYSQL_PREREGISTRATION.md`). sysbench's published OLTP workloads ask for rows from a set of tables that steps through the pool and past it, the same transactions in both arms. Each run holds three paired repetitions; the paired difference's 95% interval within a run, and the same sign with every interval clear of zero across the three runs, make a reading **confirmed better** or **confirmed WORSE**; a run whose interval includes zero reads **no difference beyond the noise** (with the count of such runs); clear runs pointing different ways read **the runs disagree**. Errors: any increase in any run is WORSE. Memory held is the resource; the host's CPU-seconds, the compass's own cost included, are measured on GitHub's shared runner, and no energy is claimed beyond them. The tuning workload is shown and not counted. Every row is shown, losses included.
