GitHub Actions run 37344765837, the live controller at rules 1-8 with amendments 9 (idle read from the autoscaler's floor) and 12 (cruise steps back). 240 jobs of real CPU work, 60 at a time, the service's load generator at zero. Raw files with their SHA-256 sums: `results/live/raw/run-37344765837/`. Rebuilt with `python3 tools/live_reps.py`.


## All columns, mean over repetitions

| node-hours | 2.514 | 1.994 |
| energy, parked workers still on at idle power (Wh, declared model) | 273.2 | 273 |
| energy, parked workers at 25 W standby (Wh, declared model; kind never does this) | 273.2 | 234.2 |
| response time (ms), mean | 487.6 | 430.4 |
| response time (ms), 95th percentile | 2889 | 2806 |
| response time (ms), 99th percentile | 4464 | 4403 |
| time over the response line (% of samples) | 15.42 | 15.2 |
| failed requests (%) | 0.3096 | 0.2357 |
| pods with no machine to take them (unschedulable) | 0 | 0 |
| time pods had no machine to take them, pod-minutes | 0 | 0 |
| pending pods in a 15 s snapshot, pod-minutes (a pod being started counts too: shown, not judged) | 183.9 | 190.6 |

| CPU used (cores), mean | 1.483 | 1.48 |

| HPA replicas, mean | 1.984 | 2.371 |
| pods started | 0.1 | 0 |
| pod start wait, total (s) | 4.5 | 0 |
| pod start wait, mean (s) | 4.5 | 0 |
| host CPU busy, the real machine under kind (%) | 42.3 | 43.22 |
| host cores (the real machine under kind) | 4 | 4 |
| batch: queue finished (s) | 575.3 | 581.9 |
| batch: worker machines in service after the queue finished, mean | 6 | 4.055 |

**Energy on kind is a declared model, not a meter.** Every worker stays powered and Ready in every arm; the first
energy row counts a parked worker at its full idle power, which is what kind does. The second counts it at the
declared standby power, which needs a node autoscaler that really removes the machine; this run has none.
