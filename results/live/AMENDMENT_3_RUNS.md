# The third amendment (a lower target never held): capacity, fairness and fault tests, 10 paired repetitions each

Commit `583c97f` (rules 1 to 4), 2026-10-04, GitHub Actions workflow `benchmark-reps`, arms native / omni / compass, order
rotated, open-loop load. Transcribed from each run's `aggregate` job; each run's artifact `live-reps` holds every table,
the allocation law's in full. Design: `docs/K8S_COMPASS_PREREGISTRATION.md`, "The third amendment". Evidence class **L**.
The first runs to carry the real machine under kind: a GitHub runner of **4 cores, 48% to 70% busy** in every arm,
where "used / allocatable" reads 0.07 to 0.10 because each kind worker reports the same four cores as its own.

| Test | Run | Aggregate job | `live-reps` zip SHA-256 |
|---|---|---|---|
| capacity | 37182800270 | 111392550612 | `0bd093f835d0b3a7218109d2650f2624ccc89fb6e5f1edbf8008d2e202f0e02d` |
| fairness | 37182801578 | 111387185768 | `e97c32c069b7b8bcac2463cc03014a1a4c4e50e2f685076e0c7e4974835062e7` |
| faults | 37182803035 | 111386924282 | `89b6258c26fb11f69b5c054c2fce346e8c692b1a542eea71a275795abf005cf1` |

**Result. The compass law: no measure more than 2% worse in any of the three tests.**

- **Capacity:** compass law 24.0 against native's 16.2 requests a second, **+48.1% (+5.7 to +9.9)**, no measure worse;
  allocation law 25.2, **+55.6% (+6.7 to +11.3)**, no measure worse.
- **Fairness:** compass law, neither application worse; one row significant, energy per core-hour on the declared 25 W
  standby model **+1.5%**, inside the 2% the rule allows. The allocation law: php-apache's failures −38.5%, response
  times a third lower, and the neighbour no longer worse (+2.2%, not significant; under the previous setting +5.3%).
- **Faults:** compass law, no measure worse; recovery from a lost machine 54 s faster (−61%).
