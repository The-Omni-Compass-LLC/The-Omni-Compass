Source: GitHub Actions workflow `big-organism-detached`, two rented Azure machines (eastus, `Standard_D8as_v4`, 8 vCPUs, 31 GB), each deleted after its collect. **The four stacked at 1,000 copies**: started by run 37564821425 and collected by run 37754612102 (`results/live/raw/run-37754612102/`), three paired repetitions one after another over 29 hours (2026-10-07 03:07 to 2026-10-08 07:41 UTC), commit `126b8941`. **The whole tower at 1,000 copies** (945,000 modelled muscles): started by run 37756284680 and collected by run 37945866426 (`results/live/raw/run-37945866426/`), three paired repetitions one after another over 25.4 hours (2026-10-08 09:29 to 2026-10-09 10:54 UTC), commit `6f0f93e5`. Both on **Omni v3** (`tools/omni_version.py --commit`), both with a 10,800 s window an arm (240 organism steps of 45 s), both arms of every repetition on the clock (the tower 14 to 15 s behind its window, the stack about 22 s: a fifth of one percent or less). Native: the stacks' own controllers and the cluster's HPA alone. Three repetitions give wide intervals on the paired rows; every row is shown.

Each organism runs on the measured window's clock with the cluster as one more muscle (`tools/run_kil.py`): its own compute demand drives the load generator, the cluster's watts are its heat and load. Native: the stacks' own controllers and Kubernetes alone. Omni: the compass law on every simulated muscle and the live controller on the cluster, handed back at 90% of the window. Cluster rows are measured on the real cluster (energy is the declared power model; the bill, where present, is Azure's own count of machines). Organism rows are models (evidence S).

How to read it: every change is omni against native (omni is Omni-Compass on top of native), and the Reading column says in words whether it is better or worse. Lower is better for response times, time over the line, failed requests, pods started, replicas, machines, energy and the bill (less spent). Higher is better for the organism's work and work per energy. A change whose interval crosses zero is marked inside the noise. The organism must keep the window's clock: the row "organism behind its window" says how long after the window its last step ended (0 is on the clock), and a repetition where either arm ended more than 5% of the window late is marked OFF THE CLOCK in the organism's line, because its last steps saw a cluster whose load schedule had already ended.
