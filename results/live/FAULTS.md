GitHub Actions run 37262797634, the live controller frozen at rules 1-8 (commit 353903683009; amendment 9, the brake at the idle floor, could not fire in this run: the service was never at its floor). Raw files with their SHA-256 sums: `results/live/raw/run-37262797634/`. Rebuilt with `python3 tools/live_reps.py` on those files.


## All columns, mean over repetitions

| Gauge | native | omni |
|---|---:|---:|
| worker nodes in service, mean | 5.915 | 5.901 |
| node-hours | 1.494 | 1.493 |
| energy, parked workers still on at idle power (Wh, declared model) | 166.2 | 166.1 |
| energy, parked workers at 25 W standby (Wh, declared model; kind never does this) | 164.6 | 164.2 |
| response time (ms), mean | 212.1 | 139 |
| response time (ms), 95th percentile | 367.6 | 146.8 |
| response time (ms), 99th percentile | 1361 | 1155 |
| time over the response line (% of samples) | 8.001 | 6.195 |
| failed requests (%) | 5.352 | 4.815 |
| pods with no machine to take them (unschedulable) | 0 | 0 |
| time pods had no machine to take them, pod-minutes | 0 | 0 |
| pending pods in a 15 s snapshot, pod-minutes (a pod being started counts too: shown, not judged) | 0.7017 | 0.165 |
| utilisation (used / allocatable) | 0.07249 | 0.07105 |
| CPU used (cores), mean | 1.715 | 1.678 |
| Omni's own CPU (cores), mean | 0 | 0.00975 |
| CPU used with Omni's own (cores), mean | 1.715 | 1.688 |
| energy per core-hour (Wh, the 25 W standby model; a ratio over CPU used: shown, not judged) | 387.6 | 394 |
| HPA replicas, mean | 8.873 | 9.107 |
| pods started | 4.3 | 3.1 |
| pod start wait, total (s) | 22 | 7.4 |
| pod start wait, mean (s) | 4.554 | 1.692 |
| host CPU busy, the real machine under kind (%) | 48.97 | 48.47 |
| host cores (the real machine under kind) | 4 | 4 |

**Energy on kind is a declared model, not a meter.** Every worker stays powered and Ready in every arm; the first
energy row counts a parked worker at its full idle power, which is what kind does. The second counts it at the
declared standby power, which needs a node autoscaler that really removes the machine; this run has none.

## omni (compass law): Omni-Compass on top of native, push and pull on the HPA target and the node pool vs native, 10 paired repetitions

## The fault test: the same faults at the same moments in every arm

Time to recover: from the fault's start until responses stay under the line for 30 seconds straight (at most 300 s). Over the line: the share of response samples over the line or failed in the 300 seconds after the fault. Paired means over the repetitions; lower is better in both.

| Fault | Arm | Time to recover (s) | Over the line (%) | Change in recovery against native |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| machine down | native | 70 | 14.6 |  |
| machine down | omni | 42 | 9.9 | -28 s (-40%) |
| spike | native | 267 | 67.7 |  |
| spike | omni | 266 | 65.4 | -1 s (-0%) |
| runaway pod started | native | 105 | 10.6 |  |
| runaway pod started | omni | 98 | 8.8 | -7 s (-6%) |
| probe blind | native | 66 | 0.4 |  |
