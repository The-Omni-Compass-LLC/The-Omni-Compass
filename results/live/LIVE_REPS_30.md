# Repeated live runs on kind, set 30: native, Omni-Compass on top with the allocation law, and with the compass law and the verdict, the operator's HPA target handed back at once when a fault is over, 10 paired repetitions

Source: GitHub Actions workflow `benchmark-reps`, run 37105047258, commit `acc1c4e`, 2026-10-03, job `aggregate`
(job 111160884531, `python tools/live_reps.py reps`), fixed-rate load (equal work in every arm), 900 measured seconds
per arm. Transcribed from the job's printed receipt; the run's artifact `live-reps` (zip SHA-256
`d8c72f5fa76a2de0e5d67c0ab200147aeb2734bd8e68bfbbbe6ce6be363e0cb7`) holds the same tables. Evidence class **L**
(real Kubernetes software on kind; energy is a declared model, not a meter).

What changed from set 29: one thing, written before the run (`docs/K8S_COMPASS_PREREGISTRATION.md`, the fault test): once
responses are back inside the band, the line is clean and nothing waits, the compass hands the operator's HPA target back
at once, never held by the autoscaler's window. **No measure in either arm is significantly worse than native.** Total
CPU including Omni-Compass's own: compass −6.5%, allocation law −6.7%, both inside the 2% rule.
