Run: benchmark-reps 36351987055, commit 82d46a7. Five paired repetitions (native, me on top, me alone back to back on
one runner, order rotated), 15 minutes each, kind with 1 control plane and 6 workers.

A change is significant when its paired 95% interval excludes zero. Lower response time is better.

## What the trail shows

**On top.**
- Machines emptied as the autoscaler scaled down, the machine with the least work first.
- No pod was moved or restarted.

**Alone.**
- My replica floor stayed at 10 for the whole run, so no pod left and no machine emptied.
- The pod reflex set that floor: "floor 10 (queue busy 0.44 vs promise 0.20, R 130 ms, S 73 ms)".
- Its bare service time S was the fastest ever seen, 73 ms, answered while one pod held 3700m.
- Once pods shared a machine at 1850m, their ordinary response read as a queue against that record.
- **Fix:** S and R now come from the same window, the pods as they are now. A change of a pod's CPU limit is no longer
  read as a queue (`tests/test_pod_reflex.py`).

**Pods not yet running.**
- A new pod could wait up to 5 s for me to open a machine I had closed with a cordon.
- **Fix, running as set 16:** the prefer-not mark. A pod that finds the open machines full is placed on a marked one
  at once.
