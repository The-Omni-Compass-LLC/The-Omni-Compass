Apache Kafka as shipped (one broker, a topic of 8 partitions); native: the consumer group at the operator's count (2); omni: the compass law on the consumer count inside [1, 8], holding the group's own end-to-end latency at 40% of the 500 ms line. The same offered load in both arms. Energy is the host's CPU seconds, the compass's own cost included. Every row is reported, losses included.

## light: 1.0 ms of work a message, 128 B, steps 1 2 3 2 3 4 5 6 5 4 3 2 1 2 1 × 30.0 s

Native capacity 1949 messages a second; base rate 292.4/s; 3 paired repetitions; engine omni-v3 (digest b53d05449ee04c4b, 40 files) at `ca745467845c`.

| Gauge | native | omni | change | 95% interval of the difference | reading |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| work inside the response line (messages a second handled within the line) | 730 | 771 | +5.7% | -143 to 225 | no difference beyond the noise |
| throughput (messages a second consumed) | 857 | 857 | -0.0% | -0.0148 to 0.00251 | no difference beyond the noise |
| end-to-end latency, 95th percentile (ms) | 2,455 | 1,736 | -29.3% | -4,323 to 2,885 | no difference beyond the noise |
| end-to-end latency, 99th percentile (ms) | 3,754 | 2,608 | -30.5% | -6,419 to 4,127 | no difference beyond the noise |
| end-to-end latency, median (ms) | 7.42 | 7.13 | -3.9% | -1.82 to 1.24 | no difference beyond the noise |
| end-to-end latency, mean (ms) | 330 | 233 | -29.3% | -574 to 380 | no difference beyond the noise |
| consumer lag, most messages waiting at once | 3,369 | 2,353 | -30.2% | -5,548 to 3,516 | no difference beyond the noise |
| consumer lag, mean messages waiting | 288 | 204 | -29.3% | -497 to 328 | no difference beyond the noise |
| messages produced and never consumed | 0 | 0 |  | 0 to 0 | same |
| consumers running, mean (the resources held) | 2 | 2.17 | +8.5% | -0.591 to 0.932 | no difference beyond the noise |
| consumers running, most at once | 2 | 2.33 | +16.7% | -1.1 to 1.77 | no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU busy (share of the run) | 0.313 | 0.315 | +0.6% | -0.00827 to 0.0122 | no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds | 558 | 562 | +0.7% | -16.4 to 24 | no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds per 1,000 messages inside the line | 1.7 | 1.63 | -4.3% | -0.397 to 0.252 | no difference beyond the noise |
| consumer changes written (the knob's moves) | 2 | 4.67 | +133.3% | -0.202 to 5.54 | shown, not judged |

Every omni arm handed back to the operator's count: yes; fail-ups: 3.
