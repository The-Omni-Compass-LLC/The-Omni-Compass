pandapower (Fraunhofer IEE, University of Kassel) solves every AC power flow; SimBench gives the grids and their year of measured-shape profiles. Native: the substation's tap changer holding its busbar at 1.00 per unit. Omni: the compass law on top of that setpoint, inside [0.97, 1.03], reading the worst voltage margin in the grid. Evidence class: an independent recognized simulator and data set (not our model).

## 1-MV-semiurb--1-sw, loads ZIP (40% Z, 30% I, 30% P)

8784 steps of 1 h. Omni handed the setpoint back: yes. Setpoint changes Omni made (hour, new setpoint, lowest and highest bus): [(168, 0.985, 0.9938, 1.025), (4864, 0.97, 0.9768, 1.025), (5030, 0.985, 0.9591, 1.025), (5224, 0.97, 0.9798, 1.025), (5227, 0.985, 0.9598, 1.025), (5444, 0.97, 0.9788, 1.025), (5483, 0.985, 0.9592, 1.025), (7905, 1.0, 0.9757, 1.025)]; each change is one tap on each of the 2 substation transformers, the hand-back at 90% of the year included. Worst power balance of any solved step: 1.1e+01 MW.
