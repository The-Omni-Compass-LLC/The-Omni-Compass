Apache Kafka as shipped (one broker, a topic of 8 partitions); native: the consumer group at the operator's count (2); omni: the compass law on the consumer count inside [1, 8], holding the group's own end-to-end latency at 40% of the 500 ms line. The same offered load in both arms. Energy is the host's CPU seconds, the compass's own cost included. Every row is reported, losses included.

## light: 1.0 ms of work a message, 128 B, steps 1 2 3 2 3 4 5 6 5 4 3 2 1 2 1 × 30.0 s

Native capacity 1927 messages a second; base rate 289.1/s; 3 paired repetitions; engine omni-v7 (digest d6d467b824c585f1, 46 files) at `1ccba53a74fe`.

| Gauge | native | omni | change | 95% interval of the difference | reading |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| work inside the response line (messages a second handled within the line) | 725 | 723 | -0.2% | -4.53 to 1.16 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| throughput (messages a second consumed) | 848 | 848 | -0.0% | -0.0125 to 0.00652 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| end-to-end latency, 95th percentile (ms) | 2,237 | 2,275 | +1.7% | -95.6 to 171 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| end-to-end latency, 99th percentile (ms) | 3,526 | 3,536 | +0.3% | -201 to 222 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| end-to-end latency, median (ms) | 8.49 | 8.16 | -3.8% | -1.42 to 0.768 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| end-to-end latency, mean (ms) | 301 | 306 | +1.7% | -12.7 to 22.6 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| consumer lag, most messages waiting at once | 3,171 | 3,181 | +0.3% | -53.1 to 71.8 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| consumer lag, mean messages waiting | 262 | 266 | +1.2% | -13.8 to 20 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| messages produced and never consumed | 0 | 0 |  | 0 to 0 | EVEN, the same |
| consumers running, mean (the resources held) | 2 | 2.25 | +12.4% | -0.3 to 0.795 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| consumers running, most at once | 2 | 2.67 | +33.3% | -0.768 to 2.1 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU busy (share of the run) | 0.335 | 0.334 | -0.3% | -0.00632 to 0.00425 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds | 575 | 574 | -0.2% | -11.6 to 9.25 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds per 1,000 messages inside the line | 1.76 | 1.76 | +0.0% | -0.0365 to 0.0374 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| consumer changes written (the knob's moves) | 2 | 5.33 | +166.7% | 0.465 to 6.2 | shown, not judged |

Every omni arm handed back to the operator's count: yes; fail-ups: 3.
