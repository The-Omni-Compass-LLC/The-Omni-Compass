Apache Kafka as shipped (one broker, a topic of 8 partitions); native: the consumer group at the operator's count (2); omni: the compass law on the consumer count inside [1, 8], holding the group's own end-to-end latency at 40% of the 500 ms line. The same offered load in both arms. Energy is the host's CPU seconds, the compass's own cost included. Every row is reported, losses included.

## burst: 2.0 ms of work a message, 256 B, steps 1 6 1 8 1 6 × 30.0 s

Native capacity 976 messages a second; base rate 109.8/s; 3 paired repetitions; engine omni-v3 (digest b53d05449ee04c4b, 40 files) at `3aac0ab7d384`.

| Gauge | native | omni | change | 95% interval of the difference | reading |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| work inside the response line (messages a second handled within the line) | 341 | 340 | -0.3% | -1.55 to -0.563 | **WORSE** |
| throughput (messages a second consumed) | 419 | 420 | +0.1% | -1.29 to 2.06 | no difference beyond the noise |
| end-to-end latency, 95th percentile (ms) | 2,594 | 2,588 | -0.2% | -150 to 140 | no difference beyond the noise |
| end-to-end latency, 99th percentile (ms) | 3,818 | 3,813 | -0.1% | -279 to 269 | no difference beyond the noise |
| end-to-end latency, median (ms) | 9.74 | 9.85 | +1.1% | -0.678 to 0.888 | no difference beyond the noise |
| end-to-end latency, mean (ms) | 388 | 398 | +2.4% | -15.6 to 34.4 | no difference beyond the noise |
| consumer lag, most messages waiting at once | 1,674 | 1,686 | +0.7% | -48.5 to 71.2 | no difference beyond the noise |
| consumer lag, mean messages waiting | 170 | 172 | +1.1% | -10 to 13.7 | no difference beyond the noise |
| messages produced and never consumed | 0 | 0 |  | 0 to 0 | same |
| consumers running, mean (the resources held) | 2 | 1.98 | -0.8% | -0.0167 to -0.0164 | better |
| consumers running, most at once | 2 | 2 | +0.0% | 0 to 0 | same |
| host CPU busy (share of the run) | 0.294 | 0.293 | -0.5% | -0.0203 to 0.0173 | no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds | 206 | 205 | -0.6% | -14.1 to 11.7 | no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds per 1,000 messages inside the line | 3.34 | 3.33 | -0.2% | -0.227 to 0.215 | no difference beyond the noise |
| consumer changes written (the knob's moves) | 2 | 4 | +100.0% | 2 to 2 | shown, not judged |

Every omni arm handed back to the operator's count: yes; fail-ups: 3.
