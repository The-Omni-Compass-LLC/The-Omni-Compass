native: every drone's shipped position controller at the planner's cruise; omni: the same, with the compass law on the cruise override inside the autopilot's limits, spending tracking slack as speed. Energy is a declared model (evidence class S) computed the same way for both arms. A cell with a collision in either arm is void. Every row is reported.

## mixed: 20 drones x 4 missions, 3 to 8 m

Paired physics trial (native, uncounted): 491 J a mission at the planner's cruise, 441 J at 1.25 x; a faster mission is cheaper and inside the safe error, so omni may move the cruise.

| Gauge | native | omni | change | direction |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| energy per mission (J, declared model: motors and avionics over the fleet window) | 499.3 | 410.5 | -17.79% | lower |
| fleet energy over the window (J, declared model) | 3.994e+04 | 3.284e+04 | -17.79% | lower |
| missions per charge at the autopilot's reserve | 5.336 | 6.49 | +21.64% | higher |
| missions over their deadline (share) | 0 | 0 | +0.000 | never more |
| drones that broke the battery reserve | 0 | 0 | +0.000 | never more |
| control ticks with two drones under half the keep-out apart (near misses) | 0 | 0 | +0.000 | never more |
| closest two drones ever came (m) | 0.2999 | 0.1741 | -41.96% | shown |
| tracking error, RMS (m; the compass's reading, held inside its band) | 0.07449 | 0.1386 | +86.02% | shown |
| mission time (s) | 18.19 | 14.38 | -20.94% | shown |
| seconds airborne per mission | 18.17 | 14.36 | -20.96% | shown |
| cruise override, mean | 1 | 1.483 | +48.32% | shown |

Missions flown: native 80, omni 80; cut off: 0 / 0; every override handed back: native True, omni True; collisions 0 / 0.
