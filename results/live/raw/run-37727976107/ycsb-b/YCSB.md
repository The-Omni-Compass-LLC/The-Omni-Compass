MongoDB as shipped with the operator's WiredTiger cache (512 MB) is native; omni is the compass law on the cache size through the server's own console inside [256, 2048] MB, holding the server's own read latency at 40% of the 1 ms line. YCSB's published core workloads, the same operations in both arms, the key space stepping through the cache and past it. Memory held is the resource; the host's CPU seconds include the compass's own cost. Every row is reported, losses included.

MongoDB 8.0.32, YCSB 0.17.0; 3,000 operations a second offered from 32 threads; 3 paired repetitions; engine omni-v3 (digest b53d05449ee04c4b, 40 files) at `7ee471b4098e`.

| Gauge | native | omni | change | 95% interval of the difference | reading |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| work inside the response line (operations a second answered within the line) | 2,875 | 2,874 | -0.1% | -5.43 to 2.38 | no difference beyond the noise |
| throughput (operations a second) | 2,879 | 2,877 | -0.1% | -5.2 to 2.26 | no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, 95th percentile (ms) | 0.359 | 0.361 | +0.4% | -0.00807 to 0.0107 | no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, 99th percentile (ms) | 0.518 | 0.522 | +0.8% | -0.0139 to 0.0219 | no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, mean (ms) | 0.168 | 0.175 | +4.2% | 0.00111 to 0.0129 | **WORSE** |
| failed operations | 0 | 0 |  | 0 to 0 | same |
| cache size held, mean (MB; the knob, the resource) | 512 | 261 | -49.0% | -262 to -240 | better |
| bytes in the cache, mean (MB) | 416 | 218 | -47.6% | -206 to -190 | better |
| pages read into the cache (misses) | 477,661 | 719,280 | +50.6% | 204,886 to 278,350 | shown, not judged |
| host CPU busy (share of the run) | 0.203 | 0.222 | +9.2% | -0.00307 to 0.0403 | no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds | 247 | 274 | +11.1% | -10.8 to 65.7 | no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds per 1,000 operations inside the line | 0.279 | 0.31 | +11.1% | -0.012 to 0.0742 | no difference beyond the noise |
| cache size changes written (the knob's moves) | 0 | 4 |  | 4 to 4 | shown, not judged |

Every omni arm handed back to the operator's cache size: yes; another writer seen: no; fail-ups: 0.
