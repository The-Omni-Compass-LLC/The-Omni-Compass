MongoDB as shipped with the operator's WiredTiger cache (512 MB) is native; omni is the compass law on the cache size through the server's own console inside [256, 2048] MB, holding the server's own read latency at 40% of the 1 ms line. YCSB's published core workloads, the same operations in both arms, the key space stepping through the cache and past it. Memory held is the resource; the host's CPU seconds include the compass's own cost. Every row is reported, losses included.

## tuning: YCSB workloada, 250,000 records × notch, steps 1 2 3 2 3 4 5 6 5 4 3 2 1 2 1 × 20.0 s (the tuning workload)

MongoDB 8.0.32, YCSB 0.17.0; 3,000 operations a second offered from 32 threads; 3 paired repetitions; engine omni-v3 (digest b53d05449ee04c4b, 40 files) at `7ee471b4098e`.

| Gauge | native | omni | change | 95% interval of the difference | reading |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| work inside the response line (operations a second answered within the line) | 2,833 | 2,841 | +0.3% | -40.5 to 57.2 | no difference beyond the noise |
| throughput (operations a second) | 2,847 | 2,854 | +0.2% | -39.6 to 53.7 | no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, 95th percentile (ms) | 0.488 | 0.485 | -0.6% | -0.0161 to 0.0101 | no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, 99th percentile (ms) | 0.693 | 0.679 | -2.0% | -0.059 to 0.0316 | no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, mean (ms) | 0.241 | 0.239 | -0.8% | -0.0123 to 0.00823 | no difference beyond the noise |
| failed operations | 0 | 0 |  | 0 to 0 | same |
| cache size held, mean (MB; the knob, the resource) | 512 | 436 | -14.9% | -108 to -44.9 | better |
| bytes in the cache, mean (MB) | 416 | 357 | -14.1% | -81.5 to -35.8 | better |
| pages read into the cache (misses) | 458,716 | 533,512 | +16.3% | 23,234 to 126,357 | shown, not judged |
| host CPU busy (share of the run) | 0.256 | 0.258 | +0.7% | -0.0881 to 0.0919 | no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds | 293 | 296 | +1.0% | -130 to 136 | no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds per 1,000 operations inside the line | 0.335 | 0.337 | +0.7% | -0.145 to 0.149 | no difference beyond the noise |
| cache size changes written (the knob's moves) | 0 | 1.67 |  | 0.232 to 3.1 | shown, not judged |

Every omni arm handed back to the operator's cache size: yes; another writer seen: no; fail-ups: 0.
