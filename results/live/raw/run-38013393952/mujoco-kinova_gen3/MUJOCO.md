MuJoCo (Google DeepMind) integrates each arm; MuJoCo Menagerie supplies the robot as its maker describes it, with the position servos the model ships with. Native: that servo tracks a pick-and-place cycle at its planned speed. Omni: the same servo and trajectory with the compass law on the speed override, inside the cycle's time line (`docs/ROBOTICS_PREREGISTRATION.md`). Energy is a declared model from MuJoCo's own torques and velocities, the same in both arms. Evidence class: S, our model on an independent simulator. Every row is shown, losses included.

## kinova_gen3: 7 joints, 10 cycles per arm, planned 8 s (segment 2.0 s, the fastest the robot's own servo tracks within 0.05 rad: 0.0171), takt 12 s

The task: 4 segments between joint-space waypoints 25% of each joint's own range either side of home (at most 0.6 rad), a minimum-jerk trajectory; the same for both arms.

Paired physics trial (native mode, not counted): a cycle at full speed cost 482.3 J, at override 0.8 478.6 J, standing draw 36.0 W included: a slower cycle is cheaper, so omni moves the override.

Omni handed the override back at the end of every cycle: yes.
