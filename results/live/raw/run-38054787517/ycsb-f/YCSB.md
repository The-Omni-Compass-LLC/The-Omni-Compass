MongoDB as shipped with the operator's WiredTiger cache (512 MB) is native; omni is the compass law on the cache size through the server's own console inside [256, 2048] MB, holding the server's own read latency at 40% of the 1 ms line. YCSB's published core workloads, the same operations in both arms, the key space stepping through the cache and past it. Memory held is the resource; the host's CPU seconds include the compass's own cost. Every row is reported, losses included.

MongoDB 8.0.32, YCSB 0.17.0; 3,000 operations a second offered from 32 threads; 3 paired repetitions; engine omni-v3 (digest b53d05449ee04c4b, 40 files) at `ca745467845c`.

| Gauge | native | omni | change | 95% interval of the difference | reading |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| work inside the response line (operations a second answered within the line) | 5,704 | 5,695 | -0.2% | -28.5 to 11.1 | no difference beyond the noise |
| throughput (operations a second) | 5,719 | 5,710 | -0.1% | -27.8 to 10.7 | no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, 95th percentile (ms) | 0.44 | 0.437 | -0.8% | -0.0127 to 0.00607 | no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, 99th percentile (ms) | 0.643 | 0.639 | -0.6% | -0.0083 to 0.000303 | no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, mean (ms) | 0.255 | 0.253 | -1.0% | -0.00894 to 0.00383 | no difference beyond the noise |
| failed operations | 0 | 0 |  | 0 to 0 | same |
| cache size held, mean (MB; the knob, the resource) | 512 | 447 | -12.8% | -78.1 to -52.8 | better |
| bytes in the cache, mean (MB) | 417 | 366 | -12.1% | -58.8 to -42.4 | better |
| pages read into the cache (misses) | 679,843 | 779,882 | +14.7% | 80,783 to 119,297 | shown, not judged |
| host CPU busy (share of the run) | 0.282 | 0.281 | -0.7% | -0.0248 to 0.0211 | no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds | 476 | 473 | -0.7% | -54.8 to 48.4 | no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds per 1,000 operations inside the line | 0.179 | 0.178 | -0.6% | -0.02 to 0.0179 | no difference beyond the noise |
| cache size changes written (the knob's moves) | 0 | 2.67 |  | 1.23 to 4.1 | shown, not judged |

Every omni arm handed back to the operator's cache size: yes; another writer seen: no; fail-ups: 0.
