MongoDB as shipped with the operator's WiredTiger cache (512 MB) is native; omni is the compass law on the cache size through the server's own console inside [256, 2048] MB, holding the server's own read latency at 40% of the 1 ms line. YCSB's published core workloads, the same operations in both arms, the key space stepping through the cache and past it. Memory held is the resource; the host's CPU seconds include the compass's own cost. Every row is reported, losses included.

## tuning: YCSB workloada, 250,000 records × notch, steps 1 2 3 2 3 4 5 6 5 4 3 2 1 2 1 × 20.0 s (the tuning workload)

MongoDB 8.0.32, YCSB 0.17.0; 3,000 operations a second offered from 32 threads; 3 paired repetitions; engine omni-v3 (digest b53d05449ee04c4b, 40 files) at `7ee471b4098e`.

| Gauge | native | omni | change | 95% interval of the difference | reading |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| work inside the response line (operations a second answered within the line) | 2,892 | 2,894 | +0.1% | -0.855 to 4.56 | no difference beyond the noise |
| throughput (operations a second) | 2,901 | 2,903 | +0.1% | 0.432 to 3.93 | better |
| latency, 95th percentile (ms) | 0.372 | 0.377 | +1.2% | -0.0106 to 0.0193 | no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, 99th percentile (ms) | 0.556 | 0.562 | +1.0% | -0.00471 to 0.0154 | no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, mean (ms) | 0.16 | 0.163 | +1.9% | -0.000367 to 0.00634 | no difference beyond the noise |
| failed operations | 0 | 0 |  | 0 to 0 | same |
| cache size held, mean (MB; the knob, the resource) | 512 | 448 | -12.5% | -63.8 to -63.8 | better |
| bytes in the cache, mean (MB) | 416 | 367 | -11.7% | -51.3 to -46.3 | better |
| pages read into the cache (misses) | 464,965 | 511,410 | +10.0% | 40,823 to 52,067 | shown, not judged |
| host CPU busy (share of the run) | 0.2 | 0.205 | +2.7% | -0.114 to 0.124 | no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds | 246 | 254 | +3.3% | -174 to 190 | no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds per 1,000 operations inside the line | 0.278 | 0.287 | +3.3% | -0.197 to 0.215 | no difference beyond the noise |
| cache size changes written (the knob's moves) | 0 | 1 |  | 1 to 1 | shown, not judged |

Every omni arm handed back to the operator's cache size: yes; another writer seen: no; fail-ups: 0.
