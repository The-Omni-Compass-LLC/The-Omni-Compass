Apache Kafka as shipped (one broker, a topic of 8 partitions); native: the consumer group at the operator's count (2); omni: the compass law on the consumer count inside [1, 8], holding the group's own end-to-end latency at 40% of the 500 ms line. The same offered load in both arms. Energy is the host's CPU seconds, the compass's own cost included. Every row is reported, losses included.

## heavy: 5.0 ms of work a message, 1024 B, steps 1 2 3 2 3 4 5 6 5 4 3 2 1 2 1 × 30.0 s

Native capacity 393 messages a second; base rate 58.9/s; 3 paired repetitions; engine omni-v3 (digest b53d05449ee04c4b, 40 files) at `3aac0ab7d384`.

| Gauge | native | omni | change | 95% interval of the difference | reading |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| work inside the response line (messages a second handled within the line) | 147 | 147 | -0.2% | -0.833 to 0.228 | no difference beyond the noise |
| throughput (messages a second consumed) | 173 | 173 | -0.0% | -0.00244 to 0.000995 | no difference beyond the noise |
| end-to-end latency, 95th percentile (ms) | 2,401 | 2,437 | +1.5% | -120 to 190 | no difference beyond the noise |
| end-to-end latency, 99th percentile (ms) | 3,795 | 3,718 | -2.0% | -255 to 101 | no difference beyond the noise |
| end-to-end latency, median (ms) | 11.3 | 11.3 | -0.0% | -0.114 to 0.104 | no difference beyond the noise |
| end-to-end latency, mean (ms) | 322 | 324 | +0.5% | -4.51 to 7.69 | no difference beyond the noise |
| consumer lag, most messages waiting at once | 702 | 701 | -0.2% | -47.8 to 45.2 | no difference beyond the noise |
| consumer lag, mean messages waiting | 59 | 59 | -0.1% | -1.09 to 0.924 | no difference beyond the noise |
| messages produced and never consumed | 0 | 0 |  | 0 to 0 | same |
| consumers running, mean (the resources held) | 2 | 1.99 | -0.3% | -0.00665 to -0.00665 | better |
| consumers running, most at once | 2 | 2 | +0.0% | 0 to 0 | same |
| host CPU busy (share of the run) | 0.277 | 0.277 | -0.3% | -0.00924 to 0.00784 | no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds | 497 | 496 | -0.2% | -16.7 to 14.4 | no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds per 1,000 messages inside the line | 7.49 | 7.49 | -0.0% | -0.246 to 0.242 | no difference beyond the noise |
| consumer changes written (the knob's moves) | 2 | 4 | +100.0% | 2 to 2 | shown, not judged |

Every omni arm handed back to the operator's count: yes; fail-ups: 3.
