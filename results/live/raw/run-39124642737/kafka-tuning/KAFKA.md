Apache Kafka as shipped (one broker, a topic of 8 partitions); native: the consumer group at the operator's count (2); omni: the compass law on the consumer count inside [1, 8], holding the group's own end-to-end latency at 40% of the 500 ms line. The same offered load in both arms. Energy is the host's CPU seconds, the compass's own cost included. Every row is reported, losses included.

## tuning: 2.0 ms of work a message, 256 B, steps 1 2 3 2 3 4 5 6 5 4 3 2 1 2 1 × 30.0 s (the tuning workload)

Native capacity 975 messages a second; base rate 146.2/s; 3 paired repetitions; engine omni-v10 (digest 4bf39b0d707784de, 47 files) at `8b902df8d857`.

| Gauge | native | omni | change | 95% interval of the difference | reading |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| work inside the response line (messages a second handled within the line) | 366 | 365 | -0.2% | -4.55 to 3.02 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| throughput (messages a second consumed) | 429 | 429 | -0.0% | -0.00459 to -0.000151 | LOSS |
| end-to-end latency, 95th percentile (ms) | 2,348 | 2,363 | +0.6% | -305 to 335 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| end-to-end latency, 99th percentile (ms) | 3,731 | 3,783 | +1.4% | -113 to 216 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| end-to-end latency, median (ms) | 8.58 | 8.57 | -0.1% | -0.176 to 0.158 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| end-to-end latency, mean (ms) | 316 | 321 | +1.8% | -26.7 to 38.4 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| consumer lag, most messages waiting at once | 1,671 | 1,683 | +0.7% | -81.2 to 105 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| consumer lag, mean messages waiting | 140 | 142 | +1.5% | -12 to 16.3 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| messages produced and never consumed | 0 | 0 |  | 0 to 0 | EVEN, the same |
| consumers running, mean (the resources held) | 2 | 1.99 | -0.3% | -0.00667 to -0.00663 | GAIN |
| consumers running, most at once | 2 | 2 | +0.0% | 0 to 0 | EVEN, the same |
| host CPU busy (share of the run) | 0.311 | 0.309 | -0.7% | -0.00827 to 0.004 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds | 541 | 537 | -0.7% | -16.3 to 8.59 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds per 1,000 messages inside the line | 3.28 | 3.27 | -0.5% | -0.12 to 0.087 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| consumer changes written (the knob's moves) | 2 | 4 | +100.0% | 2 to 2 | shown, not judged |

Every omni arm handed back to the operator's count: yes; fail-ups: 3.
