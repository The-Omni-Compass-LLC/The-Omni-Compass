Apache Kafka as shipped (one broker, a topic of 8 partitions); native: the consumer group at the operator's count (2); omni: the compass law on the consumer count inside [1, 8], holding the group's own end-to-end latency at 40% of the 500 ms line. The same offered load in both arms. Energy is the host's CPU seconds, the compass's own cost included. Every row is reported, losses included.

## light: 1.0 ms of work a message, 128 B, steps 1 2 3 2 3 4 5 6 5 4 3 2 1 2 1 × 30.0 s

Native capacity 1917 messages a second; base rate 287.6/s; 3 paired repetitions; engine omni-v3 (digest b53d05449ee04c4b, 40 files) at `ca745467845c`.

| Gauge | native | omni | change | 95% interval of the difference | reading |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| work inside the response line (messages a second handled within the line) | 726 | 729 | +0.4% | -13.7 to 19.2 | no difference beyond the noise |
| throughput (messages a second consumed) | 843 | 843 | +0.0% | -0.012 to 0.0128 | same |
| end-to-end latency, 95th percentile (ms) | 2,018 | 1,838 | -9.0% | -1,253 to 891 | no difference beyond the noise |
| end-to-end latency, 99th percentile (ms) | 3,343 | 3,004 | -10.1% | -1,596 to 918 | no difference beyond the noise |
| end-to-end latency, median (ms) | 8.19 | 7.93 | -3.2% | -0.99 to 0.472 | no difference beyond the noise |
| end-to-end latency, mean (ms) | 272 | 248 | -8.8% | -149 to 101 | no difference beyond the noise |
| consumer lag, most messages waiting at once | 2,982 | 2,727 | -8.6% | -1,450 to 940 | no difference beyond the noise |
| consumer lag, mean messages waiting | 235 | 215 | -8.6% | -126 to 85.6 | no difference beyond the noise |
| messages produced and never consumed | 0 | 0 |  | 0 to 0 | same |
| consumers running, mean (the resources held) | 2 | 2.13 | +6.5% | -0.457 to 0.717 | no difference beyond the noise |
| consumers running, most at once | 2 | 2.33 | +16.7% | -1.1 to 1.77 | no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU busy (share of the run) | 0.327 | 0.329 | +0.4% | -0.0366 to 0.0391 | no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds | 561 | 566 | +0.9% | -61.1 to 71 | no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds per 1,000 messages inside the line | 1.72 | 1.73 | +0.5% | -0.19 to 0.208 | no difference beyond the noise |
| consumer changes written (the knob's moves) | 2 | 5.33 | +166.7% | -2.4 to 9.07 | shown, not judged |

Every omni arm handed back to the operator's count: yes; fail-ups: 3.
