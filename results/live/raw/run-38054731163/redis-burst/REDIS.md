Redis as shipped with the operator's ceiling (64 MB, allkeys-lru) is native; omni is the compass law on the ceiling through Redis's own console inside [16, 512] MB, holding the application's own request latency at 40% of the 2 ms line (a hit is inside, a miss and its 5 ms store trip outside). The same requests in both arms. Memory held is the resource; the host's CPU seconds include the compass's own cost. Every row is reported, losses included.

## burst: 8192 B values, working set 2,500 keys × notch, steps 1 6 1 8 1 6 × 30.0 s

Redis 7.0.15; 1500 requests a second offered; 3 paired repetitions; engine omni-v3 (digest b53d05449ee04c4b, 40 files) at `ca745467845c`.

| Gauge | native | omni | change | 95% interval of the difference | reading |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| work inside the response line (requests a second answered within the line) | 1,074 | 1,075 | +0.1% | -0.772 to 1.91 | no difference beyond the noise |
| throughput (requests a second) | 1,500 | 1,500 | -0.0% | -0.0057 to 0.0028 | same |
| cache hit rate | 0.717 | 0.717 | -0.0% | -0.00122 to 0.00108 | no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, 95th percentile (ms) | 5.22 | 5.22 | +0.0% | -1.76e-05 to 0.00211 | no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, 99th percentile (ms) | 5.31 | 5.31 | -0.2% | -0.0906 to 0.0731 | no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, mean (ms) | 1.55 | 1.54 | -0.2% | -0.0157 to 0.00857 | no difference beyond the noise |
| failed requests | 0 | 0 |  | 0 to 0 | same |
| memory ceiling held, mean (MB; the knob, the resource) | 64 | 61.3 | -4.3% | -2.87 to -2.61 | better |
| memory used, mean (MB) | 57.2 | 55.3 | -3.2% | -1.96 to -1.7 | better |
| keys evicted | 71,745 | 71,777 | +0.0% | -254 to 317 | shown, not judged |
| host CPU busy (share of the run) | 0.0494 | 0.0532 | +7.6% | -0.0983 to 0.106 | no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds | 34.4 | 37.4 | +8.8% | -71.8 to 77.9 | no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds per 1,000 requests inside the line | 0.178 | 0.194 | +8.8% | -0.372 to 0.403 | no difference beyond the noise |
| ceiling changes written (the knob's moves) | 0 | 10 |  | 10 to 10 | shown, not judged |

Every omni arm handed back to the operator's ceiling: yes; another writer seen: no; fail-ups: 9.
