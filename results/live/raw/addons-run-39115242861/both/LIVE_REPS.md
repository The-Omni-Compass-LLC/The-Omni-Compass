<!-- how to read this receipt (tools/readings.py) -->
**How to read this receipt.** Every judged row reads one of three words, decided by what its gauge is for and never by the plus or minus sign of its number. **GAIN**: the gauge moved toward its declared aim against native (more work done, a shorter wait, fewer misses or failures, or a resource cut). **EVEN**: native and Omni-Compass could not be told apart (the 95% interval includes zero: no difference beyond the noise), or the knob is at its limit on native. **LOSS**: the gauge moved away from its aim (less work done, a longer wait, more misses or failures). A resource spent or held (energy, the power drawn and its peaks and swings, machines, memory, processor time, a bill, wear) that fell is a cut, a GAIN; one that rose is **power given**, what Omni-Compass put in to buy the work and the speed shown beside it, always shown and never called a loss; work bought with each unit of a resource (work per energy) that fell is power given too. So a minus can read GAIN (a response time cut) and a plus can read LOSS (failed requests up). A reading counts when it holds the same way in all three of our runs, A, B and C, with every interval clear of zero; **the runs disagree** names a test unstable there; **shown, not judged** is a gauge declared shown only. The output follows the input: every reading is the result of the tune, the wiring and the load it names, and where a reading elsewhere differs the first presumption is the wiring (`DISCLOSURES.md`, section 4). The full key, letter by letter: `docs/HOW_TO_READ_THE_RESULTS.md`. Run and scored by The Omni-Compass LLC's own code. No outside party has reviewed or approved these results. Preregistered means the rules were written down in our own repository before the runs; nothing was filed with any outside body.

**Energy on kind is a declared model, not a meter.** Every worker stays powered and Ready in every arm; the first
energy row counts a parked worker at its full idle power, which is what kind does. The second counts it at the
declared standby power, which needs a node autoscaler that really removes the machine; this run has none.

**The babysitting tax.** Omni-Compass runs on autopilot: no person touched a setting in either arm. An alert
minute is a whole minute whose 95th percentile, failed requests counted over, was over the line: a minute an
on-call page would be open. The commands are the settings the governor wrote on its own, each in its audit with
its reason; the share decided inside the line counts its additions (a machine more, or a lower HPA target) made
before the line was crossed. The alert minutes are judged; the commands and the share are shown, not judged.
