Redis as shipped with the operator's ceiling (64 MB, allkeys-lru) is native; omni is the compass law on the ceiling through Redis's own console inside [16, 512] MB, holding the application's own request latency at 40% of the 2 ms line (a hit is inside, a miss and its 5 ms store trip outside). The same requests in both arms. Memory held is the resource; the host's CPU seconds include the compass's own cost. Every row is reported, losses included.

## small: 2048 B values, working set 10,000 keys × notch, steps 1 2 3 2 3 4 5 6 5 4 3 2 1 2 1 × 30.0 s

Redis 7.0.15; 1500 requests a second offered; 3 paired repetitions; engine omni-v10 (digest 4bf39b0d707784de, 47 files) at `8b902df8d857`.

| Gauge | native | omni | change | 95% interval of the difference | reading |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| work inside the response line (requests a second answered within the line) | 926 | 937 | +1.2% | 11.2 to 11.9 | GAIN |
| throughput (requests a second) | 1,500 | 1,500 | -0.0% | -0.0139 to -0.00557 | LOSS |
| cache hit rate | 0.617 | 0.625 | +1.2% | 0.00744 to 0.00798 | GAIN |
| latency, 95th percentile (ms) | 5.62 | 5.64 | +0.2% | -0.0309 to 0.0564 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, 99th percentile (ms) | 5.69 | 5.7 | +0.3% | -0.0183 to 0.0564 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, mean (ms) | 2.18 | 2.16 | -1.2% | -0.0654 to 0.0127 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| failed requests | 0 | 0 |  | 0 to 0 | EVEN, the same |
| memory ceiling held, mean (MB; the knob, the resource) | 64 | 65.4 | +2.1% | 1.14 to 1.58 | power given |
| memory used, mean (MB) | 60.7 | 61.9 | +2.0% | 1.16 to 1.31 | power given |
| keys evicted | 243,159 | 234,810 | -3.4% | -8,533 to -8,167 | shown, not judged |
| host CPU busy (share of the run) | 0.125 | 0.123 | -1.4% | -0.0346 to 0.0312 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds | 221 | 216 | -2.2% | -74.4 to 64.7 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds per 1,000 requests inside the line | 0.531 | 0.513 | -3.4% | -0.185 to 0.148 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| ceiling changes written (the knob's moves) | 0 | 13.7 |  | 7.93 to 19.4 | shown, not judged |

Every omni arm handed back to native's ceiling (64 MB): yes; another writer seen: no; fail-ups: 16.
