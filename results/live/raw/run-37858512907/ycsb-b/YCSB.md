MongoDB as shipped with the operator's WiredTiger cache (512 MB) is native; omni is the compass law on the cache size through the server's own console inside [256, 2048] MB, holding the server's own read latency at 40% of the 1 ms line. YCSB's published core workloads, the same operations in both arms, the key space stepping through the cache and past it. Memory held is the resource; the host's CPU seconds include the compass's own cost. Every row is reported, losses included.

MongoDB 8.0.32, YCSB 0.17.0; 3,000 operations a second offered from 32 threads; 3 paired repetitions; engine omni-v3 (digest b53d05449ee04c4b, 40 files) at `310cf31838e7`.

| Gauge | native | omni | change | 95% interval of the difference | reading |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| work inside the response line (operations a second answered within the line) | 2,858 | 2,856 | -0.1% | -7.07 to 3.29 | no difference beyond the noise |
| throughput (operations a second) | 2,864 | 2,862 | -0.1% | -6.68 to 2.72 | no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, 95th percentile (ms) | 0.406 | 0.406 | -0.1% | -0.00607 to 0.0054 | no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, 99th percentile (ms) | 0.568 | 0.565 | -0.5% | -0.0401 to 0.0341 | no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, mean (ms) | 0.213 | 0.215 | +1.1% | -0.00283 to 0.00757 | no difference beyond the noise |
| failed operations | 0 | 0 |  | 0 to 0 | same |
| cache size held, mean (MB; the knob, the resource) | 512 | 369 | -28.0% | -231 to -55.5 | better |
| bytes in the cache, mean (MB) | 415 | 302 | -27.2% | -189 to -37 | better |
| pages read into the cache (misses) | 488,743 | 613,152 | +25.5% | 26,796 to 222,021 | shown, not judged |
| host CPU busy (share of the run) | 0.211 | 0.213 | +1.0% | -0.0356 to 0.0397 | no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds | 241 | 242 | +0.7% | -51.4 to 54.6 | no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds per 1,000 operations inside the line | 0.273 | 0.275 | +0.7% | -0.0583 to 0.062 | no difference beyond the noise |
| cache size changes written (the knob's moves) | 0 | 2.33 |  | 0.899 to 3.77 | shown, not judged |

Every omni arm handed back to the operator's cache size: yes; another writer seen: no; fail-ups: 0.
