pandapower (Fraunhofer IEE, University of Kassel) solves every AC power flow; SimBench gives the grids and their year of measured-shape profiles. Native: the substation's tap changer holding its busbar at 1.00 per unit. Omni: the compass law on top of that setpoint, inside [0.97, 1.03], reading the worst voltage margin in the grid. Evidence class: an independent recognized simulator and data set (not our model).

## 1-MV-comm--2-sw, loads ZIP (40% Z, 30% I, 30% P)

8784 steps of 1 h. Omni handed the setpoint back: yes. Setpoint changes Omni made (hour, new setpoint, lowest and highest bus): [(168, 0.985, 0.9913, 1.025), (7905, 1.0, 0.9722, 1.025)]; each change is one tap on each of the 2 substation transformers, the hand-back at 90% of the year included. Worst power balance of any solved step: 1.2e+01 MW.
