Apache Kafka as shipped (one broker, a topic of 8 partitions); native: the consumer group at the operator's count (2); omni: the compass law on the consumer count inside [1, 8], holding the group's own end-to-end latency at 40% of the 500 ms line. The same offered load in both arms. Energy is the host's CPU seconds, the compass's own cost included. Every row is reported, losses included.

## tuning: 2.0 ms of work a message, 256 B, steps 1 2 3 2 3 4 5 6 5 4 3 2 1 2 1 × 30.0 s (the tuning workload)

Native capacity 973 messages a second; base rate 146.0/s; 3 paired repetitions; engine omni-v3 (digest b53d05449ee04c4b, 40 files) at `ca745467845c`.

| Gauge | native | omni | change | 95% interval of the difference | reading |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| work inside the response line (messages a second handled within the line) | 365 | 365 | +0.0% | -1.94 to 1.98 | no difference beyond the noise |
| throughput (messages a second consumed) | 428 | 428 | -0.0% | -0.00812 to 0.00663 | no difference beyond the noise |
| end-to-end latency, 95th percentile (ms) | 2,337 | 2,327 | -0.4% | -214 to 193 | no difference beyond the noise |
| end-to-end latency, 99th percentile (ms) | 3,608 | 3,577 | -0.9% | -254 to 191 | no difference beyond the noise |
| end-to-end latency, median (ms) | 8.59 | 8.56 | -0.3% | -0.0701 to 0.0234 | no difference beyond the noise |
| end-to-end latency, mean (ms) | 312 | 311 | -0.4% | -18.7 to 16 | no difference beyond the noise |
| consumer lag, most messages waiting at once | 1,657 | 1,655 | -0.1% | -23.2 to 18.5 | no difference beyond the noise |
| consumer lag, mean messages waiting | 138 | 137 | -0.8% | -6.69 to 4.44 | no difference beyond the noise |
| messages produced and never consumed | 0 | 0 |  | 0 to 0 | same |
| consumers running, mean (the resources held) | 2 | 1.99 | -0.3% | -0.00665 to -0.00665 | better |
| consumers running, most at once | 2 | 2 | +0.0% | 0 to 0 | same |
| host CPU busy (share of the run) | 0.309 | 0.309 | +0.0% | -0.0122 to 0.0125 | no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds | 535 | 537 | +0.3% | -20 to 23.6 | no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds per 1,000 messages inside the line | 3.26 | 3.27 | +0.3% | -0.135 to 0.157 | no difference beyond the noise |
| consumer changes written (the knob's moves) | 2 | 4 | +100.0% | 2 to 2 | shown, not judged |

Every omni arm handed back to the operator's count: yes; fail-ups: 3.
