CityLearn (see each district file) (Intelligent Environments Lab, University of Texas at Austin; MIT license): an independent simulator of real buildings from measured data, with its own controllers and its own scoring. Native: CityLearn's rule-based battery controller (BasicRBC). Omni: the same controller with the compass law on top of its battery commands (gain 0.5, response 1.0 h, glide 0.05 an hour, band from the past week's district draw, handed back at 90% of the year). Every number is CityLearn's own score: the controller over no battery at all, lower is better for every row. Evidence class: an independent recognized simulator (not our model).
