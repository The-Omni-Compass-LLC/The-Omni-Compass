MongoDB as shipped with the operator's WiredTiger cache (512 MB) is native; omni is the compass law on the cache size through the server's own console inside [256, 2048] MB, holding the server's own read latency at 40% of the 1 ms line. YCSB's published core workloads, the same operations in both arms, the key space stepping through the cache and past it. Memory held is the resource; the host's CPU seconds include the compass's own cost. Every row is reported, losses included.

## tuning: YCSB workloada, 250,000 records × notch, steps 1 2 3 2 3 4 5 6 5 4 3 2 1 2 1 × 30.0 s (the tuning workload)

MongoDB 8.0.32, YCSB 0.17.0; 3,000 operations a second offered from 32 threads; 3 paired repetitions; engine omni-v3 (digest b53d05449ee04c4b, 40 files) at `3aac0ab7d384`.

| Gauge | native | omni | change | 95% interval of the difference | reading |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| work inside the response line (operations a second answered within the line) | 2,888 | 2,886 | -0.1% | -10.6 to 6.81 | no difference beyond the noise |
| throughput (operations a second) | 2,897 | 2,894 | -0.1% | -11.6 to 6.68 | no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, 95th percentile (ms) | 0.36 | 0.358 | -0.6% | -0.016 to 0.0113 | no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, 99th percentile (ms) | 0.554 | 0.548 | -1.1% | -0.0232 to 0.0112 | no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, mean (ms) | 0.223 | 0.22 | -1.0% | -0.0111 to 0.00645 | no difference beyond the noise |
| failed operations | 0 | 0 |  | 0 to 0 | same |
| cache size held, mean (MB; the knob, the resource) | 512 | 458 | -10.5% | -90.7 to -17.2 | better |
| bytes in the cache, mean (MB) | 418 | 377 | -9.8% | -72.7 to -9.45 | better |
| pages read into the cache (misses) | 679,201 | 753,696 | +11.0% | 35,022 to 113,969 | shown, not judged |
| host CPU busy (share of the run) | 0.224 | 0.222 | -1.1% | -0.0488 to 0.0439 | no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds | 382 | 377 | -1.4% | -100 to 89.2 | no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds per 1,000 operations inside the line | 0.288 | 0.283 | -1.4% | -0.0759 to 0.0677 | no difference beyond the noise |
| cache size changes written (the knob's moves) | 0 | 3.67 |  | 0.798 to 6.54 | shown, not judged |

Every omni arm handed back to the operator's cache size: yes; another writer seen: no; fail-ups: 0.
