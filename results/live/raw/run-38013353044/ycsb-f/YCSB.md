MongoDB as shipped with the operator's WiredTiger cache (512 MB) is native; omni is the compass law on the cache size through the server's own console inside [256, 2048] MB, holding the server's own read latency at 40% of the 1 ms line. YCSB's published core workloads, the same operations in both arms, the key space stepping through the cache and past it. Memory held is the resource; the host's CPU seconds include the compass's own cost. Every row is reported, losses included.

MongoDB 8.0.32, YCSB 0.17.0; 3,000 operations a second offered from 32 threads; 3 paired repetitions; engine omni-v3 (digest b53d05449ee04c4b, 40 files) at `3aac0ab7d384`.

| Gauge | native | omni | change | 95% interval of the difference | reading |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| work inside the response line (operations a second answered within the line) | 5,407 | 5,334 | -1.3% | -372 to 226 | no difference beyond the noise |
| throughput (operations a second) | 5,427 | 5,355 | -1.3% | -371 to 227 | no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, 95th percentile (ms) | 0.335 | 0.336 | +0.3% | -0.00148 to 0.00348 | no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, 99th percentile (ms) | 0.538 | 0.544 | +1.1% | -0.00846 to 0.0198 | no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, mean (ms) | 0.227 | 0.236 | +4.0% | 0.000268 to 0.0178 | **WORSE** |
| failed operations | 0 | 0 |  | 0 to 0 | same |
| cache size held, mean (MB; the knob, the resource) | 512 | 495 | -3.3% | -26.9 to -6.42 | better |
| bytes in the cache, mean (MB) | 413 | 399 | -3.6% | -22.6 to -6.85 | better |
| pages read into the cache (misses) | 644,615 | 658,622 | +2.2% | -55,797 to 83,811 | shown, not judged |
| host CPU busy (share of the run) | 0.232 | 0.24 | +3.8% | -0.025 to 0.0426 | no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds | 420 | 440 | +4.9% | -60.3 to 101 | no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds per 1,000 operations inside the line | 0.168 | 0.179 | +6.5% | -0.0275 to 0.0495 | no difference beyond the noise |
| cache size changes written (the knob's moves) | 0 | 4 |  | 4 to 4 | shown, not judged |

Every omni arm handed back to the operator's cache size: yes; another writer seen: no; fail-ups: 0.
