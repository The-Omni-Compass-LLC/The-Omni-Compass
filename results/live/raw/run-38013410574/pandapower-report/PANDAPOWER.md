# Omni-Compass on top of a distribution grid's own voltage control (pandapower, SimBench)

pandapower (Fraunhofer IEE, University of Kassel) solves every AC power flow; SimBench gives the grids and their year of measured-shape profiles. Native: the substation's tap changer holding its busbar at 1.00 per unit. Omni: the compass law on top of that setpoint, inside [0.97, 1.03], reading the worst voltage margin in the grid. Evidence class: an independent recognized simulator and data set (not our model).

8784 steps of 1 h. Omni handed the setpoint back: yes. Setpoint changes Omni made (hour, new setpoint, lowest and highest bus): [[168, 0.985, 0.9936, 1.025], [7905, 1.0, 0.9711, 1.025]]; each change is one tap on each of the 2 substation transformers, the hand-back at 90% of the year included. Worst power balance of any solved step: 1.2e-08 MW.
