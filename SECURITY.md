## Reporting a vulnerability

Report a suspected vulnerability privately to The Omni-Compass LLC through www.omni-compass.com, never in a public issue,
pull request or discussion. Include the version and commit, what you saw, how to reproduce it, and its likely impact. We
acknowledge reports, keep the reporter informed, and coordinate disclosure: a fix or a mitigation is published before the
details are, and the reporter is credited if they wish. Please give us a reasonable time to fix before any disclosure, do
not access data that is not yours, and do not disrupt any system; good-faith research that follows this policy will not
be pursued by us.

## What is in scope

The engine, the controllers, the plugs and wiring, the harnesses, the workflows and the verifier in this repository.
Third-party software Omni-Compass runs on or connects to (Kubernetes, KEDA, Karpenter, NVIDIA drivers, databases) is
reported to its own maintainers.

## How Omni-Compass is built to fail safe

- The governor issues control actions only through the shield (`omnicompass/shield.py`, `cpp/src/shield.cpp`), inside the
  cover the operator granted, and never fights another writer.
- It snapshots every setting once, before its first write, and the kill switch (`python3 tools/omni_switch.py off`) hands
  every setting back; a dead-man lease hands them back if the governor stops.
- It runs under least privilege: on Kubernetes, a service account with `kubectl auth can-i` receipts for what it can and
  cannot do (`deploy/kind/rbac-omni.yaml`).
- It contains no telemetry and makes no network connection of its own except to the systems an operator points it at.
- Every release carries a software bill of materials (`sbom/`) and a seal of the engine and its twins (`results/SEAL.json`,
  `python3 verify.py`).
- The capture script (`fleet/capture/kube_capture.sh`) is read-only; no component writes to a live cluster unless the
  operator starts it in a writing mode.
