# The 8-GPU result, one command on a rented machine with several NVIDIA cards (docs/GPU_RUN_GUIDE.md, section D):
#
#   sudo bash scripts/gpu_8card.sh            the whole design, about 17 to 18 hours
#   sudo POOLED=1 bash scripts/gpu_8card.sh   every stage, repetitions pooled across the cards, about 9 to 10 hours
#   sudo FAST=1 bash scripts/gpu_8card.sh     the short design, about 3.5 hours (what only a full server shows)
#
# Every card on the machine runs the whole card test at the same time (scripts/gpu_rented_run.sh with GPU=<card>): its
# own wire check, envelope, smoke, the two preregistered confirmations (compute and AI token generation) and the
# operator's power cap underneath, each card its own firmware alone against the firmware with Omni-Compass on top, on
# the same committed code. The cards share one machine, its power supply, its cooling and its neighbours' heat, as in a
# real server. Each card starts its arm rotation one step later than the card before it, so at any moment some cards
# run native and some run Omni-Compass, and no arm always meets the same neighbours.
# Then, with every card idle again: the GPU fault drill once, on card 0 (the master switch stops every governor on the
# machine, so it never runs while the cards measure). Then one pooled table per workload: every repetition of every
# card, paired within its own card (tools/gpu_reps.py), and each card's own table beside it.
#
# Last, the whole server as one: a language model served across every card at once (scripts/gpu_vllm.sh with GPU=all
# cards: vLLM tensor parallel, one Omni-Compass governor per card, the server's total GPU energy), SKIP_LLM=1 skips it.
# Then the whole stacks with a real card inside: the six organisms at 1x, 10x, 100x and 1,000x copies, full
# repetitions, each organism on its own card at the same time (SKIP_HIL=1 skips it; HIL_ARGS passes options through).
# CARDS (default: every card nvidia-smi lists), SKIP_DECODE=1, SKIP_CAP=1, SKIP_DRILL=1 as in gpu_rented_run.sh.
