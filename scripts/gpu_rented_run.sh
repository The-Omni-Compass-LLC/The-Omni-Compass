# The whole GPU test on a rented NVIDIA machine, one command (docs/GPU_RUN_GUIDE.md, section C):
#
#   sudo bash scripts/gpu_rented_run.sh
#
# 1. checks the machine (NVIDIA GPU, root, PyTorch with CUDA, power management Enabled), then the wire check
#    (tools/gpu_wire_check.py: both of the card's wires follow, read back and go home);
# 2. declares the envelope before any trial (docs/GPU_PREREGISTRATION.md, amendment 3): lowest watts =
#    max(device minimum, 70% of the limit read now), unless ENVELOPE=file.json is given;
# 3. smoke: 3 repetitions x 3 arms x 180 s (about 40 minutes). It checks the wiring on real hardware. It never counts;
# 4. if smoke is valid: the preregistered confirmation, 10 repetitions x 3 arms x 600 s (about 6 hours), on the same
#    committed code (STOP_AFTER_SMOKE=1 stops after step 3), on the pinned compute-bound workload (matrix products);
# 5. the second preregistered confirmation, the same 10 x 3 x 600 s on AI token generation (the decode workload:
#    every weight streamed from memory once per pass, batch one), about 6 hours more (SKIP_DECODE=1 skips it). Each
#    workload is its own result, never pooled;
# 6. an operator's power cap underneath (70% of the default limit): the cap alone vs the cap with Omni-Compass on top,
#    at the usual load and fully loaded (more work from the same watts), 5 repetitions each, 300 s per arm, about 3 hours
#    (SKIP_CAP=1);
# 7. the GPU fault drill, about 10 minutes: the governor killed outright, the master switch pulled, the response feed
#    blind (SKIP_DRILL=1); everything so far is then packed;
# 8. the whole stacks with this card inside (tools/run_hil.py): the four realms, the four stacked with duplicates
#    and the whole tower, each as 1, 10, 100 and 1,000 copies on one clock with the card inside, native
#    and Omni (repetitions 3, 3, 2, 1 by size; HIL_SCALES and HIL_REPS_BY_SCALE change them; SKIP_HIL=1 skips it);
# 9. real AI serving last: a language model served by vLLM, installed in its own environment, 5 repetitions x 3 arms x
#    300 s; if it cannot install or start, the stage says so and nothing before it is affected (SKIP_LLM=1);
# 10. packs every result folder into one file to send back, and prints the label each table chose by rule.
