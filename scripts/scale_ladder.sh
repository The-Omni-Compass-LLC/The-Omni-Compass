# The six organisms up the ladder of runs and sizes, on every core of this machine (tools/run_scale.py). Each rung
# writes results/scale/r<runs>-x<scale>/SCALE.md and is packed at the end. The grid tops out at 1,000 runs and 1,000x:
# by default 1,000 runs at 1x, 10x and 100x, and 100 runs at 1,000x (each receipt also shows the first 1, 10 and 100
