# Paired live repetition: every arm runs back to back on the SAME runner (same CPUs, same host, same noise), each on a
# fresh kind cluster, in an order rotated by repetition so no arm always runs first or last. Differences between arms in
# one repetition are then differences between arms, not between machines (separate runners differ by about 15% in
# p95 on their own).
# Usage: REP=n ARMS="native omni" bash scripts/kind_paired.sh   (Omni governs the muscles it is given: native vs Omni on top)
