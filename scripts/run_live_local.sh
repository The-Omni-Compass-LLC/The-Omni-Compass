# One command: the whole live comparison on real Kubernetes (kind) on any machine with Docker.
# For each repetition it builds a fresh 7-node cluster (1 control plane + 6 workers) and runs three arms in turn:
#   native  Kubernetes alone (HPA, scheduler)
#   omni    Omni-Compass on top (B): closure law, nervous system, levers, reset at the end
#   strict  Omni-Compass decides replicas and nodes (C)
# then aggregates every repetition into live_runs/LIVE_REPS.md (paired differences, 95% intervals).
# Needs: docker, kind (v0.27+), kubectl, python3 with requirements.txt, jq, curl. About 20 minutes per arm.
# Usage:  bash scripts/run_live_local.sh [repetitions=3] [seconds_per_arm=900]
