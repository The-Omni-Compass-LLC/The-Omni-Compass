Redis as shipped with the operator's ceiling (64 MB, allkeys-lru) is native; omni is the compass law on the ceiling through Redis's own console inside [16, 512] MB, holding the application's own request latency at 40% of the 2 ms line (a hit is inside, a miss and its 5 ms store trip outside). The same requests in both arms. Memory held is the resource; the host's CPU seconds include the compass's own cost. Every row is reported, losses included.

## large: 32768 B values, working set 625 keys × notch, steps 1 2 3 2 3 4 5 6 5 4 3 2 1 2 1 × 30.0 s

Redis 7.0.15; 1500 requests a second offered; 3 paired repetitions; engine omni-v7 (digest d6d467b824c585f1, 46 files) at `cf8dccec0604`.

| Gauge | native | omni | change | 95% interval of the difference | reading |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| work inside the response line (requests a second answered within the line) | 1,267 | 1,280 | +1.0% | 7.73 to 17.9 | GAIN |
| throughput (requests a second) | 1,500 | 1,500 | +0.0% | -0.00281 to 0.00505 | EVEN, the same |
| cache hit rate | 0.845 | 0.853 | +1.0% | 0.00503 to 0.0121 | GAIN |
| latency, 95th percentile (ms) | 5.74 | 5.74 | -0.1% | -0.00754 to 0.00157 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, 99th percentile (ms) | 5.8 | 5.81 | +0.1% | 0.000736 to 0.00555 | LOSS |
| latency, mean (ms) | 1.05 | 1 | -4.3% | -0.0635 to -0.0269 | GAIN |
| failed requests | 0 | 0 |  | 0 to 0 | EVEN, the same |
| memory ceiling held, mean (MB; the knob, the resource) | 64 | 63.3 | -1.1% | -2.35 to 0.991 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| memory used, mean (MB) | 61.3 | 59.7 | -2.6% | -2.87 to -0.295 | GAIN |
| keys evicted | 103,529 | 98,185 | -5.2% | -8,154 to -2,533 | shown, not judged |
| host CPU busy (share of the run) | 0.119 | 0.118 | -0.5% | -0.0422 to 0.041 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds | 199 | 199 | -0.4% | -79.5 to 78.1 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds per 1,000 requests inside the line | 0.35 | 0.345 | -1.4% | -0.143 to 0.133 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| ceiling changes written (the knob's moves) | 0 | 31 |  | 22.4 to 39.6 | shown, not judged |

Every omni arm handed back to the operator's ceiling: yes; another writer seen: no; fail-ups: 24.
