Redis as shipped with the operator's ceiling (64 MB, allkeys-lru) is native; omni is the compass law on the ceiling through Redis's own console inside [16, 512] MB, holding the application's own request latency at 40% of the 2 ms line (a hit is inside, a miss and its 5 ms store trip outside). The same requests in both arms. Memory held is the resource; the host's CPU seconds include the compass's own cost. Every row is reported, losses included.

## tuning: 8192 B values, working set 2,500 keys × notch, steps 1 2 3 2 3 4 5 6 5 4 3 2 1 2 1 × 30.0 s (the tuning workload)

Redis 7.0.15; 1500 requests a second offered; 3 paired repetitions; engine omni-v7 (digest d6d467b824c585f1, 46 files) at `cf8dccec0604`.

| Gauge | native | omni | change | 95% interval of the difference | reading |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| work inside the response line (requests a second answered within the line) | 1,184 | 1,193 | +0.8% | 4.59 to 13.2 | GAIN |
| throughput (requests a second) | 1,500 | 1,500 | -0.0% | -0.0133 to 0.0132 | EVEN, the same |
| cache hit rate | 0.79 | 0.796 | +0.8% | 0.00314 to 0.00885 | GAIN |
| latency, 95th percentile (ms) | 5.75 | 5.74 | -0.0% | -0.0163 to 0.011 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, 99th percentile (ms) | 5.8 | 5.81 | +0.1% | -0.0175 to 0.0234 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, mean (ms) | 1.35 | 1.32 | -2.3% | -0.0465 to -0.0145 | GAIN |
| failed requests | 0 | 0 |  | 0 to 0 | EVEN, the same |
| memory ceiling held, mean (MB; the knob, the resource) | 64 | 65.1 | +1.7% | 0.117 to 2.06 | power given |
| memory used, mean (MB) | 61.2 | 62 | +1.3% | -0.254 to 1.8 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| keys evicted | 138,058 | 135,106 | -2.1% | -5,185 to -720 | shown, not judged |
| host CPU busy (share of the run) | 0.121 | 0.12 | -0.6% | -0.0712 to 0.0698 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds | 201 | 200 | -0.4% | -132 to 131 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds per 1,000 requests inside the line | 0.377 | 0.373 | -1.1% | -0.251 to 0.242 | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| ceiling changes written (the knob's moves) | 0 | 19.3 |  | 13.1 to 25.6 | shown, not judged |

Every omni arm handed back to the operator's ceiling: yes; another writer seen: no; fail-ups: 21.
