Native is PostgreSQL as shipped behind PgBouncer's shipped pool of 20 server connections; omni is the same with the compass law writing the pool size through PgBouncer's own console inside [2, 90], handed back at the end. The load is pgbench, rate-limited, stepping one notch at a time, the peak notch offering native's own unlimited capacity. Every row is shown, losses included; a 95% interval of the paired difference (omni minus native) over the repetitions decides whether a change is beyond the noise. There is no watt-meter on the machine: the host's CPU-seconds are measured, no energy is claimed (`docs/POSTGRES_PREREGISTRATION.md`).

## select (-S, scale 20): line 50 ms, 3 paired repetitions

Native capacity, unlimited: 16,564 tps; base rate 2,485 tps; steps [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1] × 30 s; 64 clients. Engine omni-v11 (digest 745aa53ec8eeb67b, 47 files) at `d44261ca0c5c`.

| Gauge | native | omni | change (95% interval) | reading |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| work inside the response line (transactions a second answered within the line) | 7,284 | 7,289 | +0.1% (-0.2 to +0.4) | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| throughput (transactions a second) | 7,284 | 7,289 | +0.1% (-0.2 to +0.4) | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, 95th percentile (ms, lag included) | 1.51 | 1.46 | -3.3% (-36.7 to +30.2) | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, 99th percentile (ms) | 4.63 | 4.21 | -9.0% (-59.0 to +41.0) | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| latency, median (ms) | 0.373 | 0.373 | +0.0% (-1.2 to +1.2) | EVEN, the same |
| latency, mean (ms) | 0.597 | 0.577 | -3.3% (-24.2 to +17.5) | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| failed transactions | 0 | 0 | +0 (+0 to +0) | EVEN, the same |
| server connections alive, mean (the machines) | 19.5 | 18.4 | -5.9% (-13.6 to +1.7) | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| server connections alive, most at once | 20.0 | 20.0 | +0.0% (+0.0 to +0.0) | EVEN, the same |
| host CPU busy (share of the run) | 0.327 | 0.328 | +0.2% (-1.4 to +1.8) | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds | 482.2 | 483.4 | +0.3% (-1.4 to +2.0) | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| host CPU-seconds per 1,000 transactions inside the line | 0.147 | 0.147 | +0.2% (-1.3 to +1.7) | EVEN, no difference beyond the noise |
| the harness's own CPU-seconds (the compass's brain in the omni arm, the sampler in both; inside the host's) | 2.61 | 3.36 | +28.7% (+22.5 to +34.9) | shown, not judged |
| pool size, mean (the knob) | 20.0 | 18.9 | -5.3% (-5.6 to -5.0) | shown, not judged |

The knob handed back and read back at the end of every omni arm: yes; a foreign writer seen: no; Omni's writes per arm: 20, 11, 11; fail-ups per arm: 0, 0, 0.

Per repetition (inside the line tps / p95 ms / servers alive / pool mean):

- rep 1 (native then omni): native 7288 / 1.8 / 20.0 / 20.0; omni 7282 / 1.5 / 18.4 / 19.0
- rep 2 (omni then native): native 7280 / 1.3 / 18.6 / 20.0; omni 7290 / 1.4 / 18.1 / 18.9
- rep 3 (native then omni): native 7285 / 1.4 / 20.0 / 20.0; omni 7295 / 1.5 / 18.5 / 18.9
