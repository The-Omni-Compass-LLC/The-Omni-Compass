<!-- how to read this receipt (tools/readings.py) -->
**How to read this receipt.** Every judged row reads one of three words, decided by what its gauge is for and never by the plus or minus sign of its number. **GAIN**: the gauge moved toward its declared aim against native (more work done, a shorter wait, fewer misses or failures, or a resource cut). **EVEN**: native and Omni-Compass within 0.5% of each other (the mean of the three runs' changes under the 0.5% floor, or no change at all), or the knob is at its limit on native. **LOSS**: the gauge moved away from its aim (less work done, a longer wait, more misses or failures). A resource spent or held (energy, the power drawn and its peaks and swings, machines, memory, processor time, a bill, wear) that fell is a cut, a GAIN; one that rose is **power given**, what Omni-Compass put in to buy the work and the speed shown beside it, always shown and never called a loss; work bought with each unit of a resource (work per energy) that fell is power given too. So a minus can read GAIN (a response time cut) and a plus can read LOSS (failed requests up). A change of 0.5% or more, the mean of the three runs' changes, reads GAIN, LOSS or power given: **in all three of our runs** where A, B and C moved the same way with every interval clear of zero, otherwise **by the mean of our three runs**, with the count of runs beyond the noise beside it; **the runs disagree** names runs that moved 0.5% or more in opposite directions, a test unstable there; **shown, not judged** is a gauge declared shown only. The output follows the input: every reading is the result of the tune, the wiring and the load it names, and where a reading elsewhere differs the first presumption is the wiring (`DISCLOSURES.md`, section 4). The full key, letter by letter: `docs/HOW_TO_READ_THE_RESULTS.md`. Run and scored by The Omni-Compass LLC's own code. No outside party has reviewed or approved these results. Preregistered means the rules were written down in our own repository before the runs; nothing was filed with any outside body.
<!-- end: how to read this receipt -->

Each organism runs on the measured window's clock with the cluster as one more muscle (`tools/run_kil.py`): its own compute demand drives the load generator, the cluster's watts are its heat and load. Native: the stacks' own controllers and Kubernetes alone. Omni: the compass law on every simulated muscle and the live controller on the cluster, handed back at 90% of the window. Cluster rows are measured on the real cluster (energy is the declared power model; the bill, where present, is Azure's own count of machines). Organism rows are models (evidence S).

How to read it: every change is omni against native (omni is Omni-Compass on top of native), and the Reading column gives its word, GAIN, EVEN or LOSS, by what the gauge is for and never by its sign (the key: `docs/HOW_TO_READ_THE_RESULTS.md`): response times, time over the line and failed requests are time waited, missed or failed, so a fall is GAIN; the organism's work and work per energy are work done, so a rise is GAIN; pods started, replicas, machines, energy and the bill are resources spent, so a fall is a cut, a GAIN, and a rise is **power given**, never a loss. A change whose interval crosses zero reads EVEN, inside the noise. The organism must keep the window's clock: the row "organism behind its window" says how long after the window its last step ended (0 is on the clock), and a repetition where either arm ended more than 5% of the window late is marked OFF THE CLOCK in the organism's line, because its last steps saw a cluster whose load schedule had already ended.

10 paired repetitions.
