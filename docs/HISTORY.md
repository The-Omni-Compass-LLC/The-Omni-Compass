## State of play as written on 27 September 2026 (with the update of 28 September)


> **Superseded for live results.** The live evidence below predates sets 19 and 20. The current live table is `results/live/LIVE_PAIRED.md`; energy on kind is a declared model, not a meter. The first metered test is `scripts/gpu_paired.sh` (`docs/GPU_BENCH.md`).


> **Update, 28 September 2026.** Added since this page was written, each with its evidence:
> - **Live, set 21** (conveyance only when response time needs it): p95 -37%, machines in service -21%, CPU used +26%
>   (unchanged from set 20; its source is still open). `results/live/LIVE_REPS_21.md`.
> - **GPU governor bounded** (0.70 share floor, busy gate, 2 s decisions): on the MLPerf-calibrated modelled card,
>   +5.1% and +1.3% work per kJ with p95 within +10% (the old governor failed that guardrail at +31% and +66%).
>   Model only. `results/gpu/sim/`.
> - **Speed lock** (opt-in): speed won elsewhere spent on GPU watts, every gauge kept at least 1% faster than
>   without Omni. Model only. `results/gpu/sim/pipeline/`.
> - **CPU and GPU on one conserved power budget** (conveyance law over CPU and GPU organs): +1.4% to +5.7% work
>   served against today's fixed caps, never over the site budget. Model only. `docs/CONVEYANCE_LAW.md`,
>   `results/hardware/NODE_EXCHANGE_*.json`.
> - **The manual in the box:** `docs/INTEGRATION_MANUAL.md`; every gauge: `docs/METRICS_CATALOG.md`; against what runs
>   today: `docs/COMPARISON.md`.

This is the whole repository at the commit named in `STATE_OF_PLAY_COMMIT.txt`. Everything below can be rerun from it.

**Run it live on real Kubernetes yourself:** on any machine with Docker, kind, kubectl and Python, run
`bash RUN_LIVE.sh 3`. It builds a fresh 7-node cluster per arm, runs native, Omni on top and Omni alone, and writes
`live_runs/LIVE_REPS.md`. GitHub Actions runs the same comparison with a pushed commit whose message contains `[reps]`.

**Rerun the whole thing:** `pip install -r requirements.txt && python verify.py`. It must end
`VERIFICATION: PASS`, and it does at this commit.

## Best measured results, and where each one comes from

| Claim | Evidence | Where |
|---|---|---|
| **B (Omni on top of each platform):** 0 losing cells on held-out scenarios; strictly better on 27 of 28 platform-workload pairs | simulation, pre-registered | `tuning/B_FIX.json`, `tuning/B_TONE_HELDOUT.json` |
| **Four-cluster sites:** B 0 losses on all 7 platforms; C 0 losses vs GKE, AKS/Karpenter, CAST AI, Spot | simulation, held-out | `tuning/SITE_LEAGUE.json` |
| **C (Omni alone), one global setting, 400 never-used scenarios:** 153 better / 174 equal / 37 worse of 364 cells (Holm-corrected) | simulation, confirmatory | `tuning/CONFIRMATORY.json` |
| **C with nervous-system coordination, 400 fresh scenarios:** 151 / 173 / 40 | simulation, confirmatory | `tuning/CONFIRMATORY_COORD.json` |
| **Controllers fighting each other:** lowest of all 8 systems on web (0.07 per day) and four-cluster sites (0.56 per day) | simulation, confirmatory | same file |
| **Real demand, 1,052 recorded PlanetLab machines:** 0 losing cells of 91 | simulation on real traces | `tuning/PLANETLAB_LEAGUE.json` |
| **Faults** (machines dying, spikes, crash loops, noisy neighbours): fewest pages to a human, fastest recovery | simulation, 500 runs per workload | `results/protocol/` |
| **GPU power law** (engine cap over the MLPerf-measured performance law), against native at equal work: energy -27% to -33%, time over the heat limit -73% to -78% | simulation, held-out | `results/hardware/SUMMARY_HELDOUT.json` |
| **Site power exchange (conveyance law, manuscript Ch. 29-31):** 4 GPU groups under one site budget: 0 minutes over the site limit at 70/60/50% budgets (native 10.5/45.6/106); least energy at every budget; 31-115 fewer backlog minutes than the static split | simulation, held-out; law proved (conservation, Lyapunov, exponential convergence) | `docs/CONVEYANCE_LAW.md`, `results/hardware/SITE_EXCHANGE_HELDOUT_*.json` |
| **Same-tower OFF / observe / ON receipt:** observe identical to OFF; ON better than ChatGPT's graded-reflex build on healthy time, recovery, energy, violations and peak power (peak below OFF) | simulation, held-out | `results/tower_off_on/`, `results/external_review/CHATGPT2_REVIEW.md` |
| **Live levers under the nervous system:** 19 of 19 checks on real Kubernetes; kill switch restores everything | live, kind | `results/live/LIVE_LEVERS_2_NERVOUS.txt` |
| **Shadow pilot kit:** a read-only identity made 0 writes across 40 decisions | live, kind | `results/live/LIVE_SHADOW_1.txt` |
| **Safety shield:** 2,000,000 adversarial cases, 0 violations (the test found 2 real bugs, both fixed); C++ twin matches | test | `tests/test_shield_properties.py` |
| **C++ engine:** 100,000,000 decisions, no failures, about 2.3 µs per decision | test | `results/SOAK.json` |

## What still loses, measured

- **C, typical response time, web and four-cluster:** about 20% slower than every platform. Omni fills pods to 80%,
  where the others stop at 70%, and trades response time for energy.
- **C, machine starts and stops:** loses to plain Kubernetes and OpenShift, which hold machines steady and pay for it
  in machine-hours.
- **C, GPU and batch:** energy 1-2% worse and power and heat margins 1-4% worse than the tight packers (AKS/Karpenter,
  CAST AI, Spot).
- **Live, set 3, with a working probe:**
  - Omni kept all 6 machines. Latency near the 500 ms SLO blocks machine release.
  - There is no significant difference from native on anything else, except that C has more waiting pods.
  - The earlier live machine savings (sets 1-2) are withdrawn, because the broken probe had blinded the latency sense
    (`results/live/LIVE_REPS_PROBE_DEFECT.md`).
  - Set 4's decision trail showed why. Latency spikes from pod saturation at load steps kept the service from being
    clean, and the engine's calm stayed under the machine threshold (0.65 against 0.7). Both are addressed by the
    attribution gate and the two-way wiring above; the live test is pending (`results/live/LIVE_REPS_4_DIAGNOSIS.md`).
- **A bound, not a loss:** no controller, even one with perfect foresight, can match both the tightest packer's
  machine-hours and the calmest autoscaler's churn at once (`tuning/bound.py`).

## Two-way nervous system (new, live test pending)

Manuscript Appendix J names delay and dropout handling and feedback interpretation as the nervous system's job. The
live controller now wires both directions (`docs/TWO_WAY_NERVOUS_SYSTEM.md`).

- **Blind senses are detected against the wall clock.** A hung probe was the root cause of the live set 1-2 error.
  - A blind sense feeds the engine's `stale` channel.
  - It blocks every give-back.
- **Commands are read back.** Drift feeds the engine's `drift_ratio`. No new machine release goes out before the
  last one has landed.
- **The machine organ has its own engine view and a release gate.** Pods move first, and the headroom proof uses the
  engine's rho.

**Tests:** 75,000 blind states, 200,000 gate states, 300,000 nervous-system states.

**Live sets 5 and 6 could not run.** From 03:51 UTC GitHub refused every job, including `verify`: runner ID 0, no
steps, failed within about 2 seconds. That is GitHub declining to start runners, which on a private repository is
most often exhausted Actions minutes or a spending limit. It is not a code failure. `python verify.py` passes
locally at this commit.

## What came from the other AI builds, and what was tested

- **ChatGPT** (`results/external_review/CHATGPT_RELEASE_REVIEW.md`):
  - Its recovery reflex overrides the power envelope. Head to head, this engine is better on 11 gauges in its default
    mode and its reflex on 1. Not adopted.
  - Its CPU-frequency connector was adopted, wired under the nervous system with a schedutil floor and exact restore.
- **Grok** (`results/external_review/GROK_HARNESS_REVIEW.md`):
  - It found that the GPU arms B and C were collapsed in the hardware plant. That is a real bug.
  - The fix was combined with the engine cap into one law, which beats both versions.
