Answers reference the Claims Register (C-numbers) and the Technical Manual.

## Engineering
**Does the mathematics hold?** Equations (1) to (8), Propositions 1 to 3 and their proofs are in Manual Chapters 2 and 3. The 500/500 CONVEY/CERT result is a property of the controller (Proposition 3), shown by counterfactuals: the controller aimed at the wrong basin also scores {CORE['wrong_target']['convey5']}/500.
**Is Python the same as C++?** Yes (C1, C2). The verifier also builds a deliberately mutated C++ governor and confirms the parity test rejects it.
**Can every number be reproduced?** `python verify.py` rebuilds the C++, reruns parity, reruns the 100,000,000-decision soak and compares it with the recorded result, replays held-out scenarios and checks the pre-registered SHA-256 hashes (program fingerprints are additionally checked when the Python version matches the recorded one).

## Operations
**Better than what we run today?** Compared against a documented-behaviour reference model of Kubernetes autoscaling (HPA tolerance 0.1, 300 s scale-down stabilization, HPA targets 0.5 to 0.8; simplified Cluster Autoscaler with 10-minute unneeded time, 0.5 utilization threshold, 10-minute delay after scale-up): C8 to C12, including where Omni-Compass is worse. The reference model is not the upstream controllers (C12b); running the upstream controllers against the same scenarios is the next baseline step.
**On real traffic?** Not yet. Results use a synthetic stack model. Replay of published production traces and the pilot protocol are the next evidence steps (C14).
**What happens when it is wrong?** Observe mode changes nothing (C6). The reset returns control to the native managers at the next interval (omni_kill arm). The shield blocks actions that violate I1 to I5 (C7).
**Will it wear hardware?** Machine start/stop cycles, power-cap travel and thermal travel are measured for every arm (C12, Manual Chapter 8).

## Security
**What authority does it hold?** Capacity, replicas, power caps, rollback authorization and routing, only in AUTOPILOT, only through the shield.
**Can it expand capacity during a security block?** No: invariant I1 is enforced before execution.
**Does it replace encryption, identity or policy engines?** No. Those components are retained (fleet model, security role).

## Finance
**What does it save?** Energy per run versus current autoscaling (C8). Fleet-scale figures are modeled (C13); the governance saving comes from reduced idle and padded capacity, not from removing the decision components' own consumption.
**What does it cost to run?** C5.

## Adoption
**How is it introduced without risk?** Observe, then shadow on production telemetry, then one control loop at a time under the reset (docs/PILOT_PROTOCOL.md).

## Referees
**Was it tuned on the test data?** No. Law, shield and baselines were frozen and fingerprinted before the held-out seeds {S1} and {S2} (results/PREREGISTRATION.json).
**Where does it fail?** Backlog violations against current autoscaling (C11); the engine-dynamics ablation (Manual Chapter 8); open obligations (Manual Chapter 10).

## Phase 0: Simulation evaluation (evaluator's own environment)
Run `python verify.py`. Pass criterion: VERIFICATION: PASS.

## Phase 1: Shadow (2 to 4 weeks)
- Capture: `OUT=capture.csv INTERVAL=15 DURATION=<seconds> POWER_CMD="<site power in watts>" bash fleet/capture/kube_capture.sh` (read-only).
- Replay: `python fleet/capture_replay.py capture.csv --idle-w <W> --dyn-w <W> --site-limit-w <W> --out replay/` gives Omni-Compass's recommended node count, power cap and HPA target per decision.
- Governor in OBSERVE on production telemetry read directly from nodes (kubelet/cAdvisor metrics, power meters, queue depth).
- No write credentials are issued.
- Logged per interval: directive, native actions taken, and the observed outcome.
- Pass criteria, agreed before start: logged directives never violate I1 to I5; counterfactual analysis on at least N recorded incidents shows the directive would have reduced time-to-recovery or energy without a backlog increase beyond an agreed bound.

## Phase 2: Guarded control, one loop at a time (4 to 8 weeks)
Order: power capping; node count (Cluster Autoscaler set to observe); replica count (HPA set to observe).
- Each loop is handed over separately, with the reset tested at handover and at exit.
- Pass criteria per loop, fixed in advance: SLO attainment not worse than the preceding shadow baseline at the agreed confidence level; zero shield invariant violations; energy per unit of completed work reported with confidence intervals.
- Exit: any criterion failed triggers the reset and returns the loop to its native controller.

## Scoring your own pilot
Capture the baseline (a period before the controller, or a matched node pool left on your normal autoscaler) and the
Omni-Compass period or pool with fleet/capture/kube_capture.sh, then:
`python pilot/score.py --baseline baseline.csv --omni omni.csv [--idle-w W --dyn-w W]`
It reports node-hours and energy per used CPU core-hour, utilisation, pending-pod minutes and HPA shortfall minutes, each
with a bootstrap 95% interval over hourly blocks. Energy is measured if the captures include power_w. Run long enough
for at least 24 blocks per side, and compare matched pools at the same time where possible, because traffic changes
between periods.

## Phase 3: Component retirement
A decision component is retired only after its loop has passed Phase 2 and a one-at-a-time removal shows no degradation (keep-or-remove rule, Manual Chapter 6). Execution and security components are retained.

## Reporting
All pilot metrics, including failures, are reported in the same format as the benchmark results.
