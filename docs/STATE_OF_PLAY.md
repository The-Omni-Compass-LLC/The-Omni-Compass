**Rerun everything:** `pip install -r requirements.txt && python verify.py` ends with `VERIFICATION: PASS`.

**The afternoon of 10 October: Omni v4 ordered, the sweep closed, two faults found, the second set landed.** The founder ordered
the collective mechanism as the next engine (`docs/OMNI_V4_PLAN.md`: one body, one brain, one tick a second; a trial runs to its
full measurement and is never ended by the calm it causes; the body's cost judged, nothing anywhere made worse to make one thing
better; one trial at a time inside a body; nothing permanent; the wall belonging to the body; every wire forced through it; the
six organisms, the four realms, all realms stacked and the whole catalog, re-cut by a written rule). The final coverage sweep
against the internet added register rows 74 to 78 and five catalog families for v4, and mapped the mega-caps' closed systems to
the open analogs that carry the same muscles (`docs/COVERAGE_MAP.md`). Two faults GitHub's own runs showed and no local check had
were fixed: the release manifest, not refreshed after the morning's last document edits, and the cpu-power workflow file, refused
by GitHub since its first push for an unquoted colon; the verifier now parses every workflow file. The five live products' second
set on the amended trial rule landed (21 runs) and is archived; its early reading, from the logs, is in `docs/RERUN_2026-10-10.md`
and the manual's 16.6c: on Kafka the brain allowed the third consumer once and the whole gain returned at 2.5 consumers instead of
6 to 8, and refused on every other repetition; the trial's measurement, not the law, is the fault, and four trial rules for v4
follow from it. The legal wording on every page outside the frozen engine now reads "all patents, copyrights and trademarks",
"all rights reserved", "subject to change at any time", with www.omni-compass.com the authority of record. The repository now
keeps itself current: after every finished live run the front-page workflow archives it and `tools/front_page.py` rebuilds every
table whose three runs are in, the pages read from the tables, and the README's latest lines (`results/live/FRONT_PAGE_STATE.json`
records what each table was built from).

**Everything run again (10 October 2026, 01:24 to 01:31 UTC).** At the founder's order that every result be as of today, every
benchmark with a result was dispatched again on the current commit `3aac0ab7` (Omni v3, digest `b53d05449ee04c4b`, by
`tools/omni_version.py --commit`), native and omni, the wiring of each checked against its preregistration before the dispatch:
70 GitHub runs (the seven Kubernetes tests, the five live stacks on the brain's own verdict, the four simulators, the realms table
and the kill and long robustness scenarios, three runs each; the six organisms with the real cluster inside; the modelled grid at
1, 10, 100 and 1,000 copies) and the two big organisms at 1,000 copies on rented Azure machines, plus one replacement run for a Kafka
job GitHub's runner cut off (the record says which and why). By 12:30 UTC 69 of the 71 had landed and every
table on this page was remade from them; the tables they supersede are whole in `docs/history`. The one shard the runner's
six-hour limit cut off (the tower at 1,000 copies in the modelled grid) runs again, and that row reads the earlier run until it lands. The record, run by run
with inputs, times and ids, is `docs/RERUN_2026-10-10.md`. Not restarted, and why: the three 24-hour robustness machines (started
8 October on the same harness, byte for byte, ending about 10:15 UTC today) and the Azure fleet that can show one machine, which
waits on the family allowance those machines hold.


## In one paragraph (2026-10-10, Omni v3, every table remade)

**The engine is Omni v3, frozen and fingerprinted** (`OMNI_V3.json`, `docs/OMNI_V3.md`: v1's law and controllers byte
for byte, 945 muscles in 59 families, a do-no-harm gate on speed knobs). Every benchmark runs three times as separate
GitHub runs on it (A the result, B and C the replications) and every judged row reads confirmed better, confirmed worse,
no difference beyond the noise, or the runs disagree (`docs/OMNI_V1.md`, the rule). On 10 October every benchmark was run
again on one commit (`3aac0ab7`) and every table below was remade from the new runs; the tables they supersede are whole in
`docs/history`. **Real Kubernetes, seven tests, ten pairs each, all seven confirmed again on v3** (`results/live/V3_*.md`):
work inside the response line **+54% to +68%** in all three runs of the all-four test; the 95th percentile **−57% to −66%**
in every run of the steady, wandering, all-four and fault tests; failed requests −11% to −18% where load swings and under
faults; machines −1.7% to −2.0% at steady load and −16% to −20% on the batch queue (−26% to −33% after the queue finished),
with the standby-model energy −11% to −14% there; under the Google trace of 2011 machines −7% to −9% and p95 −64% to −67%;
beside a noisy neighbour no difference beyond the noise on every row. **The five live stacks ran for the first time with the
brain's own verdict on the knob** (the amendments of 9 October: every knob starts in watch and is written only inside the
allowance a paired trial on the stack itself has earned under the index's own reading). What they read. **PostgreSQL**
(`results/live/V3_PGBENCH.md`): connections held open **−6% to −11% on `select`, confirmed better**; the add above the
operator's 20 on `simple_update` refused, as expected; everything else inside the noise; no loss anywhere. **MySQL**
(`results/live/V3_SYSBENCH.md`): the pool held **−10% to −20% on `read_write`, confirmed better**, the pages holding data
with it; the earlier set's memory bought for the written working set is gone; the other three workloads inside the noise.
**MongoDB** (`results/live/V3_YCSB.md`): the cache held **−3% to −13% on `f`, confirmed better**; the other three inside the
noise; nothing worse. **Kafka** (`results/live/V3_KAFKA.md`) and **Redis** (`results/live/V3_REDIS.md`) read exactly nothing:
no gain and no loss, every gauge inside the noise under both objectives, because every spend trial on Kafka (36 of 36 arms)
and most on Redis were abandoned before they could be judged. **That is our wiring, found on the first set and amended the
same day** (amendment 3 in all five preregistrations): the rule of 9 October ended a spend trial when the service turned
calm, and a spend that works calms the service within seconds, so no spend could ever be judged; from amendment 3 a spend
trial runs to its samples, and the five stacks run again on it, those runs becoming the result of record when they land.
**The Omni index on the tables as they stand: +4.8%** (`results/OMNI_INDEX.md`: Kubernetes +28.9% over seven tests,
PostgreSQL +0.8%, Kafka +0.1%, Redis exactly nothing, MongoDB +0.7%, MySQL +1.0%, each category weighed the same); the
service reading **+10.7%** (Kubernetes +84.5%, the five stacks nothing). The number is down from +20.5% because the brain
refused, or could not yet judge, the spends that bought the earlier gains at a resource cost: every gain left is one the
brain proved on the stack itself, and no row anywhere is a loss. **Robustness**: the governor killed outright, every setting
handed back within the allowance in every repetition of every run, the whole window's p95 −27% to −48%; the long run, no
leak, every decision valid, no slowing, the service inside the noise in two of three runs. **The six organisms with the real
cluster inside**: the cluster's p95 lower in all 12 cells (−1% to −52%), failed requests lower in 11. **The realms**: the
published table reproduced in 3 of 3. **The simulators** read as their earlier sets (they are deterministic): power grids 67
gauge-rows better and 14 worse, the districts 71 better, 33 worse and 2 where the runs differ, the robot arms 7 better with
Gen3 moved and UR5e and iiwa left native, the drone swarms 9 better and 0 worse. The v1 tables stay as the first engine's record.

**What is shown and what is not.** Shown: more work inside the response line on the same machines and a faster tail,
on real Kubernetes, three times on a frozen engine, and again on 10 October; a real database, a buffer pool and a
storage-engine cache each giving memory back for the same service, every notch proved on the stack first; a message queue
and a cache on which the brain's first set could not yet judge a spend (amendment 3, the next set running).
Not yet shown: an energy or cloud-bill saving on real machines. Energy on kind is a declared model (the machines are
containers on one runner); Azure's bill on a 4-worker fleet read no difference beyond the noise on every gauge
(`results/live/V1_AKS_STEADY.md`, `V1_AKS_BURST.md`), which is a fleet too small to show one machine; the fleet of 40
workers in nine machine families that can show one is preregistered and dispatched (`docs/K8S_COMPASS_PREREGISTRATION.md`,
the fleet that can show one machine, amendments 1 to 3), waiting on Azure's own capacity in eastus. The real card has
not run on the current governor; every earlier card result is obsolete and is run again by the founder on rented cards.

**Wire in, or watch (9 October).** The founder's order: Omni need not be wired into every muscle; where it cannot beat
native, the muscle stays native and Omni only reads it. `docs/WIRING_VERDICTS.md` (`tools/wiring_verdicts.py`, checked by
`verify.py` against every table it reads) gives every knob in every result one of three words. Real stacks, on the sets of 10 October: 11 of 24
knob-cases **write** (six of the seven Kubernetes demands, PostgreSQL's `select`, MySQL's `read_write`, MongoDB's `f`, and
Kafka's `heavy` and `burst` on a fraction of a consumer); 0 are **the operator's choice**, because the brain's verdict took
no spend the index would read as a trade; 13 **watch** (Kubernetes beside a noisy neighbour, PostgreSQL's `simple_update` and
`tpcb_hot`, Kafka's `light`, Redis's three, MongoDB's `b`, `c` and `burst`, MySQL's `burst`, `read_only` and `update_index`:
nothing confirmed either way). No real stack carries a confirmed loss on these sets. The simulators: 21 write, 15 trades (the
four SimBench grids that export, where the lower voltage costs line losses; the seven 2023 CityLearn districts, where the bill
is worse), 3 watch (two robots the engine itself left native, one grid where nothing was bought). The 945 modelled muscles:
124 write, 13 trades, 808 watch, 746 of them because the native controller kept the reading in band and the law never wrote;
all 255 admission muscles are among the 746. Of the 12 organism cells with the real cluster inside 12 write on the cluster's gauges
(one with a replica cost beside its gains, one watching). The engine is unchanged; the page decides what an operator connects.

**The brain's own verdict, live (built 9 October; the first set landed 10 October; the second set, on amendment 3, running).** The founder's order of 9 October: the verdict must
be the brain's, in real time, on the knob, before it writes; a knob that cannot prove it pays stays native. `tools/knob_verdict.py`
wraps the frozen engine's verdict (`omnicompass/verdict.py`, unchanged) around every live knob of the five database, messaging
and cache harnesses: the knob starts in watch, a paired trial on the stack itself allows one notch at a time under the declared
objective (resource, the index's reading, or service), a refused step is not taken, a trial holds the knob, a fail-up never
spends beyond the allowance, the operator's setting is always free. Declared as amendments in the five preregistrations with the
expectation written before the runs: Redis left native under the resource objective (the first notch refused), Kafka allowed step
by step while each consumer pays, PostgreSQL's add above the operator's setting refused on simple_update, MySQL's read_write
chunks refused, MongoDB's cache given back a notch a trial. The 21 runs (the five stacks under the resource objective; Redis and
Kafka also under the service objective; three runs each) were dispatched on 10 October at 01:28 to 01:29 UTC on commit `3aac0ab7`
(`docs/RERUN_2026-10-10.md`) and landed by midday: PostgreSQL, MySQL and MongoDB gave memory back where it paid (connections −6% to −11% on `select`;
the pool −10% to −20% on `read_write`; the cache −3% to −13% on `f`) and lost nothing; Kafka and Redis read nothing, because every
spend trial on Kafka and most on Redis were abandoned before they were judged: the rule ended a spend trial when the service turned
calm, and a spend that works calms the service within seconds. Amendment 3 (all five preregistrations, 13:05 UTC) lets a spend
trial run to its samples; the five stacks run again on it, and the result of record is that set. Where the brain's verdict stands today, knob by knob
(the five stacks both ways; the cluster's machines, the card's clock, the robots' speed and the drones' cruise by the engine's own
verdict; the grids, the districts and the 945 modelled muscles by the law alone), is the last table of `docs/WIRING_VERDICTS.md`.
Inside the modelled realms the organism still
takes one directive for every muscle; the verdict per muscle there is the next engine, Omni v4, ordered on 10 October and
designed in `docs/OMNI_V4_PLAN.md` as the collective mechanism (one body, one brain); it is built next and every result is run
again on it.

## The card (evidence class P)

Every earlier card result ran on a controller since replaced and is obsolete. The one-card, card-inside-the-organisms
and eight-card runs are the founder's, on rented cards, after the CPU and cloud work, at one named commit
(`docs/GPU_RUN_GUIDE.md`, `docs/GPU_PREREGISTRATION.md`).

## Open

1. **Azure, the fleet that can show one machine**: steady and burst on 40 workers, v3; waiting on Azure's cluster
   capacity in eastus (the only region where this subscription has more than 10 cores). Then B and C.
2. **The four stacked and the tower at 1,000 copies with the real cluster inside, on v3: both done, 3 of 3 on the clock**
   (`results/live/V3_BIG_ORGANISM.md`). The stack: the cluster's p95 2.9 s → 150 ms, time over the line 51% → 0, failed
   requests 0.14% → 0, machines and energy unchanged, 22 s behind a 10,800 s window. The tower (945,000 modelled muscles,
   collected 9 October by run 37945866426 after 25 hours on its rented machine): the cluster's **p95 6.7 s → 160 ms (−98%)**,
   p99 9.1 s → 187 ms, **time over the line 76% → 0, failed requests 4.8% → 0**, all clear of zero; replicas, pods started
   and machines (6 in both arms) the same; energy inside the noise; 14 s behind the window in both arms; the organism's own
   model (shown, never in the index) energy −0.4% and work rounding-level worse by rule. Both machines deleted.
3. **The real card**: the founder's runs on Lambda, one exact commit.
4. **Robustness** (`docs/ROBUSTNESS_PREREGISTRATION.md`, no engine file changes): the kill scenario is done
   (`results/live/V3_ROBUST_KILL.md`: every setting back 7 to 11 s after the kill in 30 of 30 repetitions) and the
   governor's own CPU is tabulated (`results/live/V3_OWN_COST.md`); the long run is done (`results/live/V3_ROBUST_LONG.md`, 3 pairs × 3 runs, 7,200 s an arm: no leak, the decisions valid, no slowing, every setting handed back at the end; service inside the noise in two of three runs);
   the 24-hour run on three rented machines (scenario 2b, started 8 October 10:15 UTC) ends about 10:15 UTC on 10 October and is
   collected by the scheduled collect; the kill and long scenarios were dispatched again on 10 October (`docs/RERUN_2026-10-10.md`).
5. **YCSB on MongoDB, done** (`docs/YCSB_PREREGISTRATION.md`, `results/live/V3_YCSB.md`): the operator's WiredTiger cache
   as native, Omni on the cache size through the server's own console; four smoke runs recorded, then A, B and C on v3; the
   cache held given back by about half on two untouched workloads at no measurable cost in work, p95 or CPU, one confirmed
   loss (the burst mean latency, +2% to +4%) that the second counted set of 9 October removed (item 6); the index spans six
   real categories at +20.5%. Cassandra and Redis under YCSB and HammerDB are next in row 24.
6. **The costs in the database tables, traced and amended with the engine locked** (8 October; `docs/POSTGRES_PREREGISTRATION.md`
   amendment 2, `docs/MYSQL_PREREGISTRATION.md` amendment 2, `docs/YCSB_PREREGISTRATION.md` amendment 1; Omni v3 before and
   after, the harnesses are outside the fingerprint). PostgreSQL's +14% to +28% host CPU was our harness launching a `psql`
   process for every reading (measured: 52 ms of CPU a launch, 7,956 console logins in one workload's pooler log, +55.9 CPU-s
   on the launches against a +52.8 s host difference on a metered repetition; the pooler +1.2 s), and its +15% to +17% median
   latency was the pool shrunk into a queue the pooler itself reported: one console connection an arm and the queue line (a
   server taken back only while clients waited under 1% of the pooler's time, servers added back one per percent of
   waiting, up to the operator's 20). MySQL's read_write pool was bought for slow writes the pool cannot mend (36 of 82 grows at a miss share under
   1%): the pool grows only while missing. MongoDB's memory saving on b, c and burst was a cold cache given back before its
   first eviction (four notches in the first five seconds of every arm) and held at the floor evicting: the give-back gate is
   the miss share, as MySQL's, and the saving may fall to the noise, said beforehand. The second (PostgreSQL, MongoDB) and
   third (MySQL) counted sets run on these rules, dispatched 23:16 UTC on commit `310cf318` (PostgreSQL 37858494179,
   37858496620, 37858499033; MySQL 37858501997, 37858505059, 37858509109; MongoDB 37858512907, 37858515717, 37858519010).
   **Done, 9 October; the earlier tables are whole in `docs/history`.** PostgreSQL: CPU and median latency inside the noise on
   all three workloads, connections −36% to −38% on `select` confirmed better, the runs disagree on `tpcb_hot`, and on
   `simple_update` the add rule of amendment 1 buys connections above the operator's 20 (most at once +72% to +80%,
   confirmed worse, nothing bought): category +4.0% from +14.2%. MongoDB: the cache −21% to −36% on all four workloads,
   confirmed better, the latency cost gone, 8 rows better and 0 worse: category +8.5% from +10.2%. MySQL: burst −49% to −56%
   confirmed better; read_write memory +44% to +52% worse with CPU −4% to −6% better, a trade; read_only inside the noise
   (its earlier saving was in part the cold-start give-back); update_index disagree: category +5.2% from +12.2%. The index
   headline moves from +24.1% to **+20.5%**: smaller, and every number in it is now a gain without a harness cost under it.
7. **The queue** (`docs/REGISTER.md` section 4, `docs/PROOF_PROGRAM.md`): drone swarms on PX4 and ArduPilot (gym-pybullet-drones done), YCSB on
   Cassandra and Redis and HammerDB, Spark, OpenSearch, fio, Open-RMF, the 24-hour robustness run, Basilisk, Orekit and GMAT,
   RocketPy, Cantera (Kafka and Redis done); one or two at a time, each preregistered.
8. **The gaps the tree shows (the founder's reading, 10 October).** The index's six real categories are the cluster, PostgreSQL,
   Kafka, Redis, MongoDB and MySQL; Azure waits on its three-run close (item 1) and the card on its run on the current controller
   (item 3); the power grids and the districts are in as modelled results, never in the index by rule. Not yet a category: **a second
   and a third cloud**, AWS and Google Cloud under Azure's method (`docs/REGISTER.md` row 38; each needs its own account credential
   in a GitHub secret and an allowance of about 90 cores, about $12 a steady and $22 a burst run, nothing spent until the account
   exists); **CPU power through Linux's own governor with the RAPL meter**: **built and preregistered the same day**
   (`docs/CPU_POWER_PREREGISTRATION.md`; `tools/run_cpu_power.py`, one command `scripts/cpu_power_run.sh`, workflow `cpu-power`,
   the three-run table `tools/cpu_power_abc.py`): the kernel's governor stays native, Omni moves the frequency ceiling on top
   inside [half the top clock, the top], every notch down tried on the machine first by the brain's verdict, energy from the
   processor's own meter and a wall plug where fitted; it waits for a machine on the metal, the founder's own tower or laptop on
   Linux (free) or a rented bare-metal server (about $10), because GitHub's machines are virtual and expose neither the governor
   nor the meter (the workflow's probe says so on every dispatch); **the card's energy meter**, which the card harness already
   has (the integral of the device's power draw, the CPU package by RAPL, the wall plug where fitted, `tools/gpu_reps.py`) and
   which reads on the founder's run. **The founder's sweep of the same day** (nothing with value left out: operating systems,
   television and telecom, satellites and signals, energy, oil and minerals, finance, the platforms and social media, science and
   physics, robotics to the top) added rows 39 to 57 to the register's queue and section 3.5 to the proof program, each an open
   benchmark with a shipped controller for native and one knob for Omni, each to be preregistered before its first run; aerospace
   and rockets were already rows 32 to 36. **The second check the same night** (cars, self-driving, batteries, nuclear, power plants,
   medicine, surgery named) is written as `docs/COVERAGE_MAP.md`: every domain in the world of controllers against the register,
   with the abbreviations (AKS, CPU, UPS, GPU, AWS and the rest) each given its place; it added rows 58 to 73 (self-driving stacks,
   the EV powertrain, mobility fleets, stream processing, storage clusters, AI batch admission, games, thermal plants with nuclear as
   the model only, fabs, surgical robot servos, the other Kubernetes scalers, distributed SQL, the other brokers, CDN caches, air
   traffic, observability pipelines) and wrote the exclusions by rule: safety reserves, clinical dosing, trading decisions, weapons, a
   person's command, solvers without a controller.
9. **Omni-Compass 1.0**: when the founder declares the engine final, v3 as it stands is published as 1.0 and the older
   fingerprints go to `docs/history` as the road to it.

## Where things are

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `docs/OMNI_COMPASS_MANUAL.md` (PDF: `docs/OMNI_COMPASS_MANUAL.pdf`) | the manual: the governor, its mechanism, the wiring stack by stack, the frozen engines, the three-run rule, every result |
| `docs/RERUN_2026-10-10.md` | every benchmark dispatched again on 10 October 2026 on one commit: the record, run by run |
| `docs/OMNI_V3.md`, `docs/OMNI_V1.md` | what each engine is and every result read on it |
| `docs/REGISTER.md`, `docs/PROOF_PROGRAM.md` | every muscle, every benchmark run and still to run; the program to full size |
| `results/live/V3_*.md`, `V1_*.md`, `results/live/raw/` | the three-run tables and every archived run's files |
| `results/OMNI_INDEX.md` | the one combined number |
| `docs/BENEFIT_SHEET.md` | one number per benchmark, plus always good for Omni and minus always bad, whatever the gauge measures; yes, no, none or trade beside it |
| `docs/WIRING_VERDICTS.md`, `results/WIRING_VERDICTS.csv` | which knobs earn a wire in: write, watch or the operator's choice, per knob and per muscle, from every table, every loss with its cause |
| `docs/INTEGRATION_MANUAL.md`, `docs/WIRING_GUIDE.md` | wiring it in yourself |
| `docs/METRICS_CATALOG.md` | every gauge, and whether it is measured or modelled |
| `omnicompass/`, `omni_controller/`, `realms/`, `cpp/` | the engine, the controllers, the muscles, the C++20 twins |
| `docs/HISTORY.md` | earlier states of play, kept whole |
