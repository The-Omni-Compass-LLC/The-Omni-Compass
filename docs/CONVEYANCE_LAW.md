## 1. What the manuscript says, read as mechanism

| Source | Text | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| Ch. 29 §8 | "E_system = E + U + S + B … dE_system/dt = 0 (over full cycle). Energy redistributes. Energy reorganizes. Energy does not diverge." | The budget (site watts, cluster cores) is **conserved**: it is moved between organs, never created. |
| Ch. 31 §4 | "Redistribution B acts as mediator between the baths. When E grows locally, B increases to distribute gradients." | Budget flows **down the gradient of need**: from organs holding surplus to organs in deficit. |
| Ch. 31 §5 | "eigenvalues of the coupled system must remain bounded … Re(λᵢ) ≤ 0" | The flow must have a proof of convergence, not a tuned damper. |
| Ch. 30 §5-7 | "Redistribution surge … channels stored deviation into expansion … controlled release … No discontinuity." | A **reserve** is held and released **continuously** to organs at their limit. There is no on/off. |
| Ch. 29 §6 | "Backpressure develops through S … Compression is … structured inward rotation." | When need falls, surplus is **pulled back** smoothly. Budget nobody needs is not spent. |
| App. J | "the engine can only act through what you expose" | Organs keep their own mechanisms. The law sets only each organ's share of the budget. |

## 2. The law

**Notation.**
- Organs i = 1..n share a budget A.
- Organ i holds allocation aᵢ and has need dᵢ: the budget that serves its work at the engine's utilisation target ρ.
- Its deficit (local deviation) is

  eᵢ = dᵢ / (ρ aᵢ) − 1    (eᵢ > 0: needs juice; eᵢ < 0: holds surplus)

**The redistribution mediator:**

  daᵢ/dt = κ aᵢ (eᵢ − ē),    ē = Σⱼ aⱼ eⱼ / A

## 3. Properties and proofs

**P1. Conservation.**
- Σᵢ daᵢ/dt = κ (Σᵢ aᵢeᵢ − ē Σᵢ aᵢ) = κ (A ē − ē A) = 0.
- The budget is moved, never created, as in Ch. 29 §8.

**P2. Gradient flow with a Lyapunov function.**
- Substitute eᵢ: aᵢ(eᵢ − ē) = dᵢ/ρ − aᵢ D/(ρA), where D = Σ dᵢ.
- So daᵢ/dt = (κ/ρ)(dᵢ − aᵢ D/A).
- This is the Shahshahani gradient on the simplex Σ aᵢ = A of F(a) = Σᵢ (dᵢ/ρ) ln aᵢ. The Shahshahani metric weights
  by 1/aᵢ, and ∂F/∂aᵢ = dᵢ/(ρ aᵢ), so aᵢ(∂F/∂aᵢ − mean) is exactly the flow above.
- Along the flow dF/dt = Σᵢ (1/aᵢ)(daᵢ/dt)² · (ρ/κ) ≥ 0.
- F is strictly concave, so F is a Lyapunov function and the flow cannot cycle.

**P3. Global exponential convergence.**
- The ODE in P2 is linear: aᵢ(t) = aᵢ* + (aᵢ(0) − aᵢ*) e^(−κDt/(ρA)), with aᵢ* = A dᵢ/D.
- The Jacobian is −(κD/(ρA)) I on the simplex, so every eigenvalue is −κD/(ρA) < 0. This meets Re(λ) ≤ 0 of Ch. 31 §5
  strictly.
- At the equilibrium every organ has the same deficit e* = D/(ρA) − 1. None is starved while another idles.
- `replicator_step` integrates it exactly, in closed form, for any step size.

**P4. Bounds (floors, ceilings, the budget).**
- Allocations are projected onto {loᵢ ≤ aᵢ ≤ hiᵢ, Σ aᵢ ≤ A}.
- The projection is water-filling: organs at a bound keep it, and the rest share the remainder in proportion.
- Budget an organ cannot use (it is at its need or its ceiling) is not spent.

**P5. Reserve and surge.**
- The dual-bath rate channel (the rate tracker) projects the rise in need over one actuation delay:
  R = Σᵢ max(0, ḋᵢ), capped at A/2. R is held back.
- After the flow, R is released continuously to organs whose deficit stays positive, in proportion to their shortfall
  and up to their ceilings.
- This is the controlled release of Ch. 30: continuous state, no switch.

## 4. Evidence
**Mathematics in code.** `tests/test_conveyance.py` (in `verify.py`) checks 20,000 random systems:
- P1 conservation to 1e-9;
- P2, F never decreases;
- P3, the trajectory equals the closed form;
- P4, bounds and budget.

It also runs 2,000 systems over 30 steps and checks the full law never exceeds the budget or breaks a floor. That test
found and fixed one real bug: an organ whose need fell below its device floor was given a ceiling under that floor.

**Simulation.** `hardware/site_exchange.py`: four GPU groups of 16 H100-class GPUs share one site budget (MLPerf gamma).
Held-out seed 929292, 48 scenarios per budget. Results: `results/hardware/SITE_EXCHANGE_HELDOUT_*.json`.

| Site budget (share of TDP) | 70% | 60% | 50% |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Site-budget violation minutes, native / independent / **conveyance** | 10.5 / 1.5 / **0** | 45.6 / 10.5 / **0** | 106.1 / 31.3 / **0** |
| Energy (kWh), native / static split / independent / **conveyance** | 142.5 / 117.6 / 104.1 / **103.8** | 139.1 / 107.9 / 103.5 / **102.0** | 127.3 / 97.1 / 101.0 / **96.4** |
| Backlog minutes, static split (the arm that also keeps the budget) / **conveyance** | 32.0 / **1.0** | 89.7 / **8.9** | 187.3 / **72.2** |

**Reading.**
- **Keeping the budget.** Conveyance is the only dynamic arm that never exceeds the site budget.
- **Energy.** It uses the least energy at every budget.
- **Against the only other arm that keeps the budget (static split):** 31-115 fewer backlog minutes.
- **At tight budgets, native and independent sizing show less backlog,** but only by drawing power over the site limit
  for 10-106 minutes, which in a facility trips breakers.
- **When the budget is below total need,** conveyance shares the shortage in proportion to need. That is the unique
  stable point of P3: fair, and not a choice of weights.

**CPU and GPU on one budget.** `hardware/node_exchange.py`: the same law with CPU organs beside the GPU organs. Four
groups, each two 8-GPU servers (16 H100-class GPUs, 4 CPU sockets); each unit of GPU work needs 0.35 of the CPUs at
full clock to feed it; demand 1.6x the plant traces (the GPUs are held back by the budget, not by work). Arms:
- **S** today's practice: every GPU at one fixed cap low enough that the site fits even with every CPU at maximum;
- **XM** conveyance among the GPUs, counting the CPUs' last measured draw;
- **XC** conveyance over CPU and GPU organs together: each CPU group is held to the clock its feeding work needs, and
  the watts it no longer holds flow to the GPU groups in deficit.

Seed 515151, 24 scenarios. Results: `results/hardware/NODE_EXCHANGE_*.json`. XC against S, paired:

| Site budget (share of GPU TDP + CPU maximum) | 60% | 70% | 80% |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Work served | **+5.7%** | **+3.6%** | **+1.4%** |
| Backlog minutes | −15.8% | −27.5% | −17.8% |
| 95th-percentile latency factor | −39.6% | −43.6% | −35.2% |
| Site-budget violation minutes, native / S / XM / **XC** | 195.8 / 0 / 3.9 / **0** | 140.9 / 0 / 6.2 / **0** | 61.8 / 0 / 5.3 / **0** |

**Reading.**
- **More work from the same building.** The tighter the budget, the more the CPUs' unused watts are worth to the GPUs.
- **Holding the CPUs is what makes the hand-over safe.** Counting the CPUs' measured draw (XM) serves about as much,
  but goes over the budget for 4-6 minutes in every setting: a CPU can rise between one reading and the next. XC holds
  each CPU to its allocation, so the watts it gives up are really free, and it never goes over.
- **Most of the gain is the CPUs' reserve, not their clock.** Against XM, XC gains ~1% work per kWh; against S, the
  watts a fixed plan must keep for CPUs that might peak are what the GPUs receive.
- The same holds for the least and most favourable MLPerf gamma fits, and for CPU shares 0.2 and 0.6 (+2.3% to +4.2%
  work at the 70% budget), `tests/test_node_exchange.py` checks N1-N4 in `verify.py`.

## 5. What is not claimed
- This is a simulation on declared device physics.
- The live levers that would carry it are GPU power limits (`nvidia-smi -pl`, DCGM), RAPL package limits, and pod CPU
  limits under a namespace budget. They exist in `omni_controller/muscles.py`, but the exchange between them has not
  run on hardware.
