# The 656 Muscles: What Each Is For, and How It Is Wired

A **muscle** is one setting on one machine that already has its own control: a replica target, a node pool's size, a GPU's clock ceiling, a chiller's setpoint, a battery's reserve, a joint's effort. Omni-Compass does not replace that control. It reads the machine's meters, computes one bounded force with the bowl law, and moves the setting the machine already accepts, through a plug that reads the setting once before the first write, reads back every write, steps aside if another controller moves it, and puts it back at the end.

This chapter lists all 656 muscles of the catalog (`realms/catalog.csv`). For each one it says what kind of machine it is, which of the four kinds of knob it is, what Omni-Compass reads and does with it, how such a muscle is reached in a real stack, and which organisms it belongs to. The plants behind the benchmark numbers are models of these machines (evidence class **S**); a muscle in this list is wired on a real system only through the levels and the checks of the manual (chapters 8 and 9). See `DISCLOSURES.md`.

## How to read an entry

**The four kinds of knob.**

- **capacity**: how much of the machine is in service (replicas, instances, units, speed). Omni-Compass writes it.
- **admission**: what is let in (queues, rate limits, admission control). Omni-Compass reads it and leaves it to its own controller in the current law; it is counted, never written.
- **power**: the power share or limit the machine may draw. Omni-Compass writes it inside its cover.
- **setpoint**: the target the machine's own loop holds (a temperature, a reserve, a process value). Omni-Compass moves it inside its safe band.

**The five kinds of plant.** Every muscle is modelled on one of five plants, each with its own service reading and lever:

| Plant | What it is | What Omni-Compass reads | What Omni-Compass moves |
|---|---|---|---|
| `compute_pool` | a pool of servers, pods, GPUs, links or disks serving a stream of requests or jobs | how far its queue and its load sit toward the service line (queue or lateness, and load above half) | the capacity it may use: its replica or instance count (through its autoscaler's target or floor), its power share, or one unit given back through the release gate |
| `thermal_zone` | a data hall or building zone cooled by chillers, air handlers or fans | its temperature against its limit | its supply setpoint (colder is more cooling), its power share, or one cooling unit given back when the room has margin |
| `energy_storage` | a battery, UPS or microgrid store with a load and a grid connection | its draw on the grid connection and its reserve | its reserve setpoint (how much charge it holds back); its power limit is left native |
| `motion_axis` | a motor-driven axis: a robot joint, a flight-control surface, a reaction wheel, a traction motor | its tracking error and its load | its speed and effort share, or its power share |
| `process_loop` | a regulated process: a temperature, pressure, flow, level, voltage or composition held at a setpoint | how far the process sits from its band | its setpoint within its safe band, its actuator range, or its power share |

**The organisms.** The 656 muscles build six organisms: each of the four realms (every muscle whose realm list includes it), the four stacked with every duplicate kept (1,226), and the whole tower with every muscle once (656). A muscle of the shared spine sits in all four realms.

| Organism | Muscles |
|---|---:|
| Compute / AI / Cloud | 345 |
| Physics / Robotics / Autonomous | 262 |
| Energy / Facility / Industrial | 282 |
| Distribution / Specialized | 337 |
| The four stacked, every duplicate kept | 1,226 |
| The whole tower, every muscle once | 656 |

**How a muscle is reached in a real stack.** The class of machine decides the wire:

| Class of machine | What it is | The wire in a real stack |
|---|---|---|
| `batch` | batch and queued jobs | the job queue (Kubernetes Jobs, Slurm, Spark) |
| `building` | a building zone | the building management system |

| `commerce` | a customer-facing service with bursts | the Kubernetes API |
| `cpu_host` | a CPU host whose clock and power can be set | Linux cpufreq and RAPL |

| `database` | a database cluster | the database operator (replicas, connection pools) |
| `ev_traction` | an electric vehicle traction motor | the vehicle's motor controller (CAN; modelled only) |
| `fabric` | a high-speed fabric (RDMA, DPU, SmartNIC) | the fabric manager's API |
| `facility` | a facility battery behind the meter | the energy management system |
| `feeder_voltage` | a distribution feeder's voltage | the distribution management system (IEC 61850, DNP3; modelled only) |
| `flight_axis` | a flight-control axis | the flight controller (modelled only) |
| `gpu` | GPU serving with a response-time target | nvidia-smi (clock ceiling and power limit) or the serving autoscaler |
| `gpu_batch` | GPU training and batch work | nvidia-smi, the job scheduler's pause and resume |
| `microgrid` | a microgrid battery and loads | the inverter or energy management system (IEEE 2030.5, SunSpec, OpenADR) |
| `network` | network routing and switching | the network controller (SDN, routing API) |
| `node` | a fleet of machines or VMs that boot in minutes | the node pool's size command (Karpenter, Cluster Autoscaler, MachineSet, cloud ASG) |
| `process` | an industrial process loop | the PLC or DCS (OPC UA, EtherNet/IP, PROFINET) |
| `qpu` | a quantum or specialised accelerator queue | the accelerator's job queue |
| `ran` | a radio access network cell or site | the RAN controller (O-RAN interfaces) |
| `reaction_wheel` | a spacecraft reaction wheel | the attitude controller (modelled only) |
| `robot_fleet` | a fleet of robots or vehicles taking tasks | the fleet manager's dispatch API |
| `robot_joint` | a robot joint servo | the robot controller (ROS 2, EtherCAT, the drive's fieldbus) |
| `server` | an application service on servers or pods | the Kubernetes API (HPA target and floor, pod resize) |
| `storage` | block, file or object storage | the storage system's QoS and tiering API |
| `ups` | an uninterruptible power supply | the UPS and PDU management interface (SNMP, Modbus) |
| `water` | a water or pumping process | the SCADA system (Modbus, DNP3) |
| `workflow` | a workflow or pipeline engine | the workflow engine's concurrency settings |

Wires marked *modelled only* exist as plants in the benchmark and are not built for live use.

## The shared spine: 190 muscles in all four realms

The machines every realm stands on: servers, machines, GPUs and CPUs, network, storage, observability, security, cooling and electrical distribution. Each spine muscle is part of every realm's organism, counted once in the tower and four times in the stack.

### Runtime & Application (15 muscles)

Each is a pool of servers, pods, GPUs, links or disks serving a stream of requests or jobs; its class is `server` (an application service on servers or pods), reached through the Kubernetes API (HPA target and floor, pod resize). Omni-Compass reads how far its queue and its load sit toward the service line (queue or lateness, and load above half). Its home realm is Distribution / Specialized.
