# YCSB on MongoDB, a database's operator-set cache size: the A/B/C confirmation

MongoDB as shipped with the operator's WiredTiger cache (512 MB) is native; omni is the compass law on the cache size through the server's own console inside [256, 2,048] MB, holding the server's own mean read latency at 40% of the 1 ms line(`docs/YCSB_PREREGISTRATION.md`). YCSB's published core workloads ask for records from a key space that steps through the cache and past it, the same operations in both arms. Each run holds three paired repetitions; the paired difference's 95% interval within a run, and the same sign with every interval clear of zero across the three runs, make a reading **confirmed better** or **confirmed WORSE**; a run whose interval includes zero reads **no difference beyond the noise** (with the count of such runs); clear runs pointing different ways read **the runs disagree**. Failed operations: any increase in any run is WORSE. Memory held is the resource; the host's CPU-seconds, the compass's own cost included, are measured on GitHub's shared runner, and no energy is claimed beyond them. The tuning workload is shown and not counted. Every row is shown, losses included.

The cache size handed back to the operator's and read back at the end of every omni arm in every run: yes.

The brain's own verdict on the knob in the omni arms, one trial at a time on the stack itself (the objective: resource): run A: acting: 448 to 512 (2 trials, 1 allowed, 1 refused); acting: 448 to 512 (2 trials, 1 allowed, 1 refused); acting: 384 to 512 (2 trials, 2 allowed, 0 refused); run B: acting: 448 to 512 (3 trials, 1 allowed, 1 refused); acting: 384 to 512 (3 trials, 2 allowed, 0 refused); acting: 384 to 512 (3 trials, 2 allowed, 0 refused); run C: acting: 448 to 512 (3 trials, 1 allowed, 0 refused); acting: 384 to 512 (3 trials, 2 allowed, 0 refused); acting: 384 to 512 (3 trials, 2 allowed, 0 refused).

**Across 4 untouched workloads: 2 gauge-rows confirmed better, 0 confirmed worse, 0 where the runs disagree.**
