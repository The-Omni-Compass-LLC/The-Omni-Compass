pandapower (Fraunhofer IEE and the University of Kassel) with the SimBench benchmark grids: an independent, deterministic grid simulator with the grid's own voltage control as native. Omni sits on top of it, moving the substation setpoint one whole tap at a time under the frozen rules (`docs/PANDAPOWER_PREREGISTRATION.md`). The same grids ran three times as separate GitHub runs on the same frozen engine, a full year each, both load models. Because the simulator is deterministic, the runs must reproduce each other: a gauge reads **confirmed better** or **confirmed WORSE** when all three runs give the same sign, **same** when the change is under one part in a million, and **the runs differ** when they do not reproduce. Energy drawn, losses and import: lower is better. Bus-steps outside 0.95-1.05: any increase is WORSE. Tap operations: lower is better, and more of them was declared in advance as Omni's expected cost. Every row is shown, losses included.
