> **Why this table is in the history.** This is the first counted set of the MySQL benchmark (runs 37757840760, 37757850988,
> 37757861572, commit `23f6ca4c`, Omni v3, 2026-10-08), kept whole, every row as it was published. Its hand-back row read NO on
> four of five workloads because the plug's restore was issued while the server was still carrying out a shrink the law had asked
> for, which MySQL ignores (`docs/MYSQL_PREREGISTRATION.md`, the first set's result and the amendment). The plug was fixed and the
> second counted set (A2, B2, C2) run on it; that table is the one in `results/live/V3_SYSBENCH.md` and the one the index reads.
> The engine was the same in both sets. Nothing here was changed after publication.


MySQL as Ubuntu ships it with the operator's InnoDB buffer pool (512 MB) is native; omni is the compass law on the pool size through the server's own console inside [128, 2,048] MB in chunks of 128 MB, holding the server's own mean statement latency at 40% of the 0.6 ms statement line (`docs/MYSQL_PREREGISTRATION.md`). sysbench's published OLTP workloads ask for rows from a set of tables that steps through the pool and past it, the same transactions in both arms. Each run holds three paired repetitions; the paired difference's 95% interval within a run, and the same sign with every interval clear of zero across the three runs, make a reading **confirmed better** or **confirmed WORSE**; a run whose interval includes zero reads **no difference beyond the noise** (with the count of such runs); clear runs pointing different ways read **the runs disagree**. Errors: any increase in any run is WORSE. Memory held is the resource; the host's CPU-seconds, the compass's own cost included, are measured on GitHub's shared runner, and no energy is claimed beyond them. The tuning workload is shown and not counted. Every row is shown, losses included.

The buffer pool handed back to the operator's and read back at the end of every omni arm in every run: **NO** (2 of 9 omni arms not handed back).

**Across 4 untouched workloads: 0 gauge-rows confirmed better, 0 confirmed worse, 0 where the runs disagree.**
