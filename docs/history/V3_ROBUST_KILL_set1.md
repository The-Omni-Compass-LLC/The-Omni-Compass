Three separate GitHub runs of the same preregistered test on the same frozen engine: A is the result, B and C are the replications. Each cell is omni against native, the paired change in percent of native with its 95% interval. Every judged row gets one of three readings. **Confirmed better** or **confirmed WORSE**: all three runs move the same way and every interval is clear of zero. **No difference beyond the noise**: in the runs counted, the interval includes zero, so native and omni could not be told apart on that measure; that is the result. **The runs disagree**: runs clear of the noise point different ways, so the test itself is unstable there. Every row is shown, losses included.
