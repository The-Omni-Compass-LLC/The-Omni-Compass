PostgreSQL as shipped behind PgBouncer's shipped pool of 20 is native; omni is the compass law on the pool size through PgBouncer's own console (`docs/POSTGRES_PREREGISTRATION.md`). Each run holds three paired repetitions; the paired difference's 95% interval within a run, and the same sign with every interval clear of zero across the three runs, make a reading **confirmed better** or **confirmed WORSE**; a run whose interval includes zero reads **no difference beyond the noise** (with the count of such runs); clear runs pointing different ways read **the runs disagree**. Failed transactions: any increase in any run is WORSE. Every row is shown, losses included. The host's CPU-seconds are measured on GitHub's shared runner; no energy is claimed.
