## Status

Additive integration layer. It does **not** alter the frozen six-state engine or claim that every listed connector is already implemented or physically verified.

## Architectural invariant

A new controllable domain is a **muscle**, not a new brain:

`plant telemetry -> observation adapter -> same Omni state -> bounded authority -> shield -> actuator -> readback -> plant`

The governing state remains `(E, U, I_U, S, B, Bdot)`.

## Qualification contract

Every automatic muscle must declare and test:

1. observable input and freshness;
2. capability range, units, resolution and rate/step bounds;
3. timing: observation, decision, actuation delay, hold, cooldown, timeout and stale horizon;
4. hard safety bounds and forbidden conditions;
5. requested, bounded and realized authority;
6. independent actuator readback when supported;
7. native snapshot and restoration;
8. deterministic failure behavior;
9. automation mode: disabled, recommend, manual, external approval or automatic;
10. evidence class: design (D), simulation (S), live software (L), physical (P), commercial (C).

## Standard actuator classes

The SDK reserves contracts for Kubernetes replicas/resources/HPA/placement/node pools; host CPUFreq/cgroups/CPU/memory/I/O; GPU power/clock/MIG/admission; cloud instance count/size/placement/start-stop/capacity; storage size/tier/IOPS/throughput/placement; network weights/rate/bandwidth/routing; application concurrency/workers/queues/JVM/thread pools/batch; cooling; rack power; and site power.

A reserved class is **not evidence of implementation**. Each concrete adapter must earn its own evidence class.

## Authority receipt

Every attempted command emits the same fields: muscle identity, automation mode, requested value, bounded value, realized value, units, permit/block result, reason, observation age, actuation latency, actuator residual, evidence class and status.

## Fail-safe rule

No loss of observability, safety permission or approval may increase authority. Stale/invalid observations block writes. Recommendation/manual modes do not write. A registered automatic muscle snapshots native state before its first write and exposes restoration through the registry.

## Extension pattern

Use `FunctionalMuscle` for a small connector or implement the `MuscleAdapter` protocol for a richer one. Register it in `MuscleRegistry`. The adapter owns vendor/API details; the six-state engine does not.

## CURRENT RELEASE SYNCHRONIZATION — XPASS25

This living document is synchronized to XPASS25. Historical receipts and prior-run artifacts remain frozen and are not rewritten. The canonical six-state/eight-line CLAIM1 core, held-u law, C++ core, GPU writer/watchdog, causal evidence gate, and physical evidence contracts are unchanged from XPASS15.


Open external evidence remains: 500-scenario confirmation, Kind CLAIM1-23, and physical NVIDIA. Simulation results are not physical meter results or proprietary-product executions.
