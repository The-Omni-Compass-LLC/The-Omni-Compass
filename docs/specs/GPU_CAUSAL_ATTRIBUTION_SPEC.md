A successful `nvidia-smi -pl` command is not by itself a physical efficiency result.

## Authority chain
`canonical held u -> bounded requested limit -> driver return -> immediate/readback limit -> enforced limit -> clock-event attribution -> physical work + energy -> restoration`

The bench records both sampled board power and cumulative device energy when supported. NVIDIA DCGM/NVML clock-event reasons distinguish software power capping from GPU idle, application-clock constraints, software/hardware thermal slowdown and external hardware power brake. These are attribution evidence, not substitutes for work and joule measurements.

## Credit rule
An Omni efficiency interpretation requires the frozen workload and service guardrails to hold while the authority chain is intact. `SwPowerCap` can support that the software cap was operative. Thermal slowdown or hardware power brake is adverse/confounding evidence and is not credited to Omni. GPU idle can indicate workload starvation. Application-clock limitation identifies another authority.

## One writer
The harness uses a cooperative filesystem lock for its own power-limit writes and retains independent hardware readback because foreign writers need not honor that lock. Watch has zero write authority. DCGM is observer-only in this experiment.

## Energy hierarchy
1. GPU device counter when supported.
2. Integrated board-power samples as a cross-check.
3. CPU package RAPL as separate node-side energy evidence.
4. Independent wall/PDU energy as whole-machine evidence when fitted.

No arithmetic combination of GPU and RAPL counters is labeled wall energy.

## CURRENT RELEASE SYNCHRONIZATION — XPASS25

This living document is synchronized to XPASS25. Historical receipts and prior-run artifacts remain frozen and are not rewritten. The canonical six-state/eight-line CLAIM1 core, held-u law, C++ core, GPU writer/watchdog, causal evidence gate, and physical evidence contracts are unchanged from XPASS15.


Open external evidence remains: 500-scenario confirmation, Kind CLAIM1-23, and physical NVIDIA. Simulation results are not physical meter results or proprietary-product executions.
