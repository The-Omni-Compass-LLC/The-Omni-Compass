RAPL is CPU/package-side energy and power-budget infrastructure. It is not a GPU meter and not a wall meter.

## Meter-first path
Discover Linux powercap zones and record each zone's `name`, `energy_uj`, and `max_energy_range_uj`. Package zones are summed across sockets; DRAM and psys remain separate evidence scopes.

For a counter with range `R`:

`dE_J = ((E_end_uJ - E_start_uJ) mod R) * 1e-6`

Average power over the arm is derived from energy and elapsed time:

`P_avg_W = dE_J / dt_s`

The GPU experiment uses RAPL as an observer only. No RAPL value is added to GPU board energy and called wall energy. A PDU/smart-plug meter remains the whole-machine evidence source.

## Cap path, later
Where exposed, `constraint_0_power_limit_uw` / `constraint_0_time_window_us` and `constraint_1_*` are Linux powercap constraints. Any future CPU-cap muscle must snapshot, write, verify, and restore the applicable constraint, and must first establish that no platform daemon owns the same control surface. Raw MSR access is diagnostic fallback, not the production governor interface.

## Evidence labels
- `package-*`: CPU package scope.
- `dram`: DRAM domain when hardware/kernel exposes it.
- `psys`: wider platform/system scope on supporting platforms; not equivalent to a calibrated wall PDU.
- missing/unreadable counter: `UNAVAILABLE`, never estimated.

## CURRENT RELEASE SYNCHRONIZATION — XPASS25

This living document is synchronized to XPASS25. Historical receipts and prior-run artifacts remain frozen and are not rewritten. The canonical six-state/eight-line CLAIM1 core, held-u law, C++ core, GPU writer/watchdog, causal evidence gate, and physical evidence contracts are unchanged from XPASS15.


Open external evidence remains: 500-scenario confirmation, Kind CLAIM1-23, and physical NVIDIA. Simulation results are not physical meter results or proprietary-product executions.
