# FRONT MATTER

## Notice and Disclaimer

The software is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind. Every result in this manual carries its evidence
class (section 14). A simulated result is a statement about a model; a software benchmark is a statement about the
software it ran on; only a hardware meter speaks for hardware. Nothing in this manual is a promise of a particular
saving on a particular system. The only number that applies to your system is the one your own paired runs produce,
on your own receipt. Before Omni-Compass writes to any production system, it must run in watch mode, pass the wire
check, and be covered by a signed Omni-Compass Enterprise License.

**The wiring declaration.** Omni-Compass acts only through the wires it is given. A wrong reading, a wrong or shared
lever, a wrong range, or a service line set for another workload makes it do exactly what its law says with the wrong
information. It cannot be slapped on. If your paired receipts differ from the published benchmarks in direction, the
first presumption is wiring: confirm the installation with section 8.5 before drawing any conclusion. Every
declaration, disclosure and disclaimer is made once, in `DISCLOSURES.md`, and governs this manual.

## Foreword

I built Omni-Compass to sit on top of what already exists. Kubernetes, the GPU driver, the building controller, the
battery inverter, the robot's servo loop: those are muscles, and they are good muscles. What none of them has is one
brain that reads all of them at once, holds each of them in the middle of its safe range, and puts every setting back
exactly where it found it when it stops. That brain is Omni-Compass.

This manual is the whole of it: what the governor is, the mathematics it runs on, how its nervous system reads and
writes, how it is wired to each kind of machine, how to turn it on one level at a time, how to switch it off, and how
to prove on your own system what it does. Keep it with the code. When the code changes, this manual changes in the same
commit.

## Preface: How to Use This Manual

| You are | Read |

| CEO, board member, investor | Foreword; Part I (sections 1-3); section 14 (evidence); section 16 (license); the Executive Summary below |
| CTO, architect, head of platform | Parts I-III; section 9 (wiring levels) to plan the rollout; Part VI |

**Conventions.** `code` is a command, file or switch exactly as typed. "Native" means your system as it runs today,
without Omni-Compass. "Muscle" means any machine, service or controller Omni-Compass can read and set. "Knob" or
"lever" means one setting on a muscle. "The band" is a knob's or a service reading's safe range. Every step that
writes to a system is marked **WRITES**.

## Executive Summary

- **What it is.** A supervisory governor. It reads the meters of every muscle in your stack, computes one bounded
  force per muscle from a single closed mathematical law, and moves each muscle's own setting (a replica target, a
  clock ceiling, a power limit, a setpoint) to hold the service in the middle of its band. The muscles keep their own
  controls. Omni-Compass sets what they already accept.
- **What it does for you.** It turns the room your systems keep "just in case" into either more work for the same
  energy or the same work on fewer machines and fewer watts. On real Kubernetes (two independent sets of ten paired
  runs) it served the same traffic with about a third fewer machines in service, responses about 60% faster at the
  95th percentile, and zero failed requests (section 15).
- **How it stays safe.** It watches before it writes, records every original setting before it acts, reads back
  every write, never writes past a knob's cover, gives everything back the moment service is at risk, stops writing
  if anyone else touches a knob, and returns every setting to its original value on one OFF switch.
- **How you know.** Every run produces receipts: native against Omni-Compass on the same system, the same load and
  the same clock, with 95% intervals. Results are labelled by a rule written before the run.

# PART I - THE GOVERNOR

## 1. What Omni-Compass Is

A governor on a steam engine does not build the engine and does not turn the shaft. It watches the speed and moves the
throttle so the speed stays in a band. Omni-Compass is that, for every machine you run.

It is a process on a host. It reads meters, steps a bounded mathematical law, and writes only the levers it has been
given. It is not the chip, not the GPU driver, not Kubernetes, not the building controller. Those keep running exactly
as they do today; Omni-Compass sets the values they already accept:

| Muscle | Its own control (kept) | What Omni-Compass sets |
|---|---|---|
| Kubernetes service | the HPA | the HPA's CPU target; replica floors |
| Kubernetes node pool | Cluster Autoscaler / Karpenter / MachineSet | how many machines stay in service (park and wake) |
| NVIDIA GPU | the card's firmware (boost, power and thermal limits) | the clock ceiling (up wire) and the power limit (down wire) |
| CPU | the kernel's frequency governor | the frequency ceiling |
| Data hall, building | the chiller and air handler loops | the supply-air setpoint; units in service |
| Battery site | the inverter | the reserve level; the peak ceiling |
| Robot joint, vehicle axis | the servo loop | speed and effort limits |
| Process loop, feeder | the PI controller | the setpoint inside its band |

When Omni-Compass stops, every one of those values goes back to what it was before Omni-Compass acted.

## 2. The Muscles, the Realms and the Six Organisms

The catalog (`realms/catalog.csv`) lists 656 distinct muscles, each with its family, its plant model and its knob.
They fall into four realms. Every realm stands on the same spine (Kubernetes, machines, GPUs and CPUs, network,
storage, observability, security, cooling and electrical distribution, 190 muscles), plus its own domain muscles.

| Organism | Muscles | What it is |
|---|---:|---|
| 1. Compute / AI / Cloud | 345 | clusters, GPUs, AI training and inference, cloud capacity |
| 2. Physics / Robotics / Autonomous | 262 | joints, fleets, vehicles, flight and spacecraft axes |
| 3. Energy / Facility / Industrial | 282 | data halls, buildings, batteries, UPS, process loops, feeders |
| 4. Distribution / Specialized | 337 | networks, storage, databases, commerce, workflows, radio networks |
| 5. The four stacked, every duplicate kept | 1,226 | all four realms on one clock, the shared spine counted in each |
| 6. The whole tower, every muscle once | 656 | every distinct muscle on one clock |

These six organisms are the benchmark set. Each is run native and with Omni-Compass on top, on the same seed, the
same load and the same clock, and each produces its own receipt.

## 3. Where the Value Comes From

### 3.1 The problem we are attacking

Computing has run into a wall that is not made of silicon. Data centers cannot get the power they need, cannot get it
fast enough, and are running out of room to put more machines. AI made it worse: every new model needs more chips, and
every chip needs more electricity and more cooling. The answers on the table are expensive and slow: new chips that do
more work per watt (a new generation, new hardware to buy), new power plants and power contracts (billions, and years),
and point fixes at a single layer (an AI serving trick, a scheduler, a power cap on one chip).

We attack it from the other side. Every system already running wastes room it paid for:

- GPUs boost to the top of their clock range and are knocked back by their own power limiter many times a second;
- Kubernetes keeps replicas and machines sized for the worst minute of the day;
- cooling runs colder than the heat requires; batteries hold more reserve than the hour needs.

That room is paid for in energy, in machines and in floor space, and it produces nothing.

### 3.2 What Omni-Compass is, in one paragraph

Omni-Compass is software that sits **on top of** the controllers a system already has (the GPU's firmware, the
Kubernetes autoscaler, the building's thermostats) and governs every layer under one law: a bounded push and pull that
keeps each service in the middle of its band instead of far below its limit. It never replaces the native controller,
never asks for more than the native settings allow, hands every knob back the moment it is switched off or loses a
sense, and refuses any step that measures more than 2% worse on anything. No new hardware. It stacks on top of every
other fix a data center makes.

### 3.3 The benefit: more work from what is already paid for

The room that was spent on nothing becomes one of two things, and a company chooses which:

- **More work for the same cost:** the same machines and the same watts carry more work; or
- **The same work for less:** fewer machines in service, fewer watts, a smaller bill.

They are the same gain read from two sides (3.4). The health side comes with it: faster answers, faster recovery from
failures, nothing waiting, every knob returned, no human babysitting the stack.

### 3.4 How to read the benefit: the arithmetic

Every comparison is paired: the same system, the same work, the same moments, native alone against native with
Omni-Compass on top. Let

- *W* be the work served (requests answered, tokens generated), held equal in both arms;
- *C* be a resource it used: machine-hours, CPU core-hours, or joules.

**Productivity** is work per resource, *P = W / C*. With the work held equal, the gain from Omni-Compass on top is

  *G = P_omni / P_native − 1 = C_native / C_omni − 1.*

A gain *G* means the same resources can carry *G* more work. Read from the other side, the same work needs only

  *C_omni / C_native = 1 / (1 + G)*

of the resources, a saving of *S = G / (1 + G)*. So **a third more work (G = 33%) is a quarter off the bill
(S = 25%)**; 20% more work is 16.7% off; 50% more work is a third off. Both columns are the same measurement.

Three rules for reading any receipt:

1. **The work must be equal.** Every receipt states that the load was fixed-rate (open loop): the same requests at the
   same moments in every arm. Without that, a lower resource count could just mean less work was done.
2. **Nothing may be worse.** Beside every gain the receipt prints response times, failures, waiting and the controller's
   own CPU, each with its 95% interval. Our one rule (`DISCLOSURES.md`, section 3): no measure more than 2% worse, and
   only where energy or the bill is saved. A gain paid for with worse service is not a gain.
3. **Know the class and the comparator.** A machine-hour gain on kind (where idle machines stay powered and native has
   no node autoscaler) is not yet a bill; a modelled energy line is not a meter. Section 14 lists the classes; section 15
   says, for every result, what it is measured against.

### 3.5 Where the evidence stands today, read honestly

| What | Measured gain *G* (same work) | Class | What a referee will ask |
|---|---|---|---|
| Kubernetes machine-hours, the allocation law | +45% to +61% (sets 29 to 31, cost to match) | L | native here has no node autoscaler and the cluster is ~4% busy: the AKS bill run and the capacity test answer this |
| Kubernetes machine-hours, the compass law with the verdict | +5% to +12% | L | the same |
| Kubernetes CPU, Omni-Compass's own included | +5% to +8% | L | measured on real software |
| Kubernetes response time, 95th percentile | 57% to 66% faster; no native setting tried reached it (cost to match) | L | measured |
| Recovery from faults (machine lost, spike, runaway pod, blind probe) | faster than native from every fault, up to 49% | L | measured |
| Energy per work, kind standby model | +8% (compass) to +30% (allocation) | L, modelled | not a meter |
| Energy per work, six organisms, 1x to 1,000x | +0.08% to +0.19% | S | well-tuned native controllers in models leave little room |
| Energy per work on a real GPU | the corrected law is measuring now on a real NVIDIA A10 and next on 8 cards | P | the decisive measurement |

The upside the data points toward is large, on the order of a third more work from what is already installed on the
Kubernetes side. It becomes a claim, not a direction, when three tests land: the bill on a real cloud against Azure's
own autoscaler (`docs/AZURE_SETUP.md`), the capacity test on fixed machines under rising load, and the real-card runs
for watts. We publish each of them as it comes, whatever it says.

### 3.6 Two modes, both measured

On Kubernetes, Omni-Compass offers two laws, and a buyer chooses by what matters most:

- **Efficiency mode** (the allocation law): the most machines given back (about a third fewer in service in sets 29 to
  31) with answers still about 60% faster than native;
- **Service mode** (the compass law with the verdict): the fastest answers (95th percentile about two thirds faster) and
  fewer machines (about 10%).

Both pass the one rule in every set since the fixes; neither is tuned to a benchmark after the fact. The laws are frozen
for every test that follows, so each new result describes exactly the code that produced the old ones.

# PART II - THE MECHANISM OF ACTION

## 4. The Engine: Eight Equations and One Control Law

The engine (`omnicompass/core.py`, frozen and fingerprinted) carries a six-part state x = (E, U, I_U, S, B, B_dot):

| State | Meaning | Physical picture |
|---|---|---|
| E | deviation: how far the system is from where it should be | a tank that fills with stress and drains on its own |
| U | alignment, between the two poles -1 and +1 | a ball in a double well: two stable poles, a hill between them |
| I_U | memory of misalignment | an integrator that remembers and slowly forgets |
| S | basin structure | a ball rolling to the bottom of its landscape |
| B, B_dot | the bath | a spring with friction that absorbs and settles energy |

The eight equations (Appendix C gives them in full):

1. dE/dt = -alpha_E E + beta_int + beta_ext + v_eff
2. dU/dt = mu U (1 - U^2) - (dE/dt)/E_max - lambda_U U + u, with |u| <= 25
3. dI_U/dt = (1 - U) - sigma_1 E - delta S - lambda_I I_U
4. v_eff = cos(omega_B t / 2) c tanh(lambda_0 + lambda_1 (U - 0.5) + lambda_2 S)
5. Phi(S) = alpha_s S^2/2 + beta_s S^3/4 - delta S
6. dS/dt = -dPhi/dS
7. d2B/dt2 = gamma_c delta S - (omega_B/Q_B) dB/dt - omega_B^2 B
8. R_B: a finite-difference audit of (7), never fed back

**The control law.** u = clip(-f_U(x, t) + K_P (sigma - U), -25, +25), where f_U is the drift of U with the command
at zero, sigma is the target pole and K_P = 12. The first term cancels whatever is shoving U (the push); the second
pulls U to its pole, harder the farther it is (the pull). The command is held unchanged through every stage of the
fourth-order Runge-Kutta step and U is never rewritten afterwards. Inside the authority limit, U converges to its pole
at rate K_P; this is proved (`docs/TRACKING_THEOREM.md`).

## 5. The Closed Circle: Why It Cannot Leave Its Compass

The governing principle is the Unified Circle Principle:

    dX/dt = G(X),  X(0) in Omega
    G(X) . n(X) <= 0 on the boundary of Omega        (the flow points inward at the wall: nothing crosses)
    grad L(X) . G(X) <= 0                            (the compass's energy L only falls)
    => lim X(t) in M*                                (every path settles in the bottom of the compass)

In control engineering the second line is the Nagumo condition for an invariant set and the third is a Lyapunov
function. Together they mean: anything that starts inside the container stays inside it, for every disturbance up to a
known size, and comes to rest at the bottom. That is a certificate, not a test: it answers every case inside the walls
at once.

The engine's states are each closed in this sense: the deviation tank drains faster than it can fill; the alignment's
cubic walls push back from far out; the memory forgets; the bath's friction settles it. The rule behind all four is
the compass's east-west line: what flows out (drain, damping) must always be able to match what flows in (drive).

**The compass.** The Omni-Compass rose carries the whole Greek alphabet, Alpha to Omega: the complete set, in a ring
whose end runs back into its beginning. Its north-south axis is polarity: Alpha and plus at the top, Omega and minus at
the bottom, the two poles of the alignment's double well. Its east-west axis is flow: Beta and the push outward on one
side, Gamma and the pull inward on the other, the drive and the damping. The spiral at the center is the attractor
every path winds into. The ring closing on itself is the return: when Omni-Compass stops, every lever returns to where
it began.

## 6. The Compass: Push, Pull and the Two Forces

The compass (`omnicompass/compass_law.py`) is the law that carries the engine's push and pull to every muscle.

**Two bands.**
- **The cover**, a knob's hard range (the device's or the operator's lowest and highest setting). Every write is
  clipped to it. Nothing Omni-Compass computes can set a knob outside it.
- **The compass**, the service reading as a position from 0 (calm) to 1 (the service line). Omni-Compass pulls that
  position to the bottom of the compass, the middle (0.5 by default; an operator may set it lower for extra margin). The
  walls run from 0.05 to 0.95; the last 5% on each side, 10% in all, is cushion.

**The force.** F = A tanh((K_P (p - center) + K_D v) / A), where p is the position, v its rate of change, A the
authority.
- **Pull:** K_P (p - center), gentle near the bottom, stronger up the walls.
- **Push:** K_D v, the force that meets whatever is shoving the position, and the friction that stops it sloshing.
  With K_D at or above critical damping the position glides to the middle and stops, with no overshoot and no
  ringing. Overshoot is wasted energy: force spent going the wrong way and spent again coming back.
- **Smooth, never a hammer:** tanh bends the force over into its maximum instead of slamming into a wall.
- **Fail up:** past the 0.95 wall the up side goes to its full force at once and the down side may not act until the
  position is back inside the compass.

**Two forces: antagonist pairs.** Like the muscles of an arm, every plug has an up side (adds capacity, power,
cooling, speed) and a down side (takes it back), each with its own gain, because adding and taking back do not cost
the same: a new machine takes minutes to boot; giving one back is instant. Where a machine has two wires, each side
gets its own lever:

| Muscle | Up force | Down force |
|---|---|---|
| GPU card | clock ceiling raised | power limit lowered (the lid) |
| Kubernetes | scale out | scale in |
| Cooling | chiller on, colder setpoint | warmer setpoint, unit released |
| Battery | discharge | charge, reserve held |
| Vehicle, joint | motor effort | braking, regeneration |

**Why the GPU needs both wires.** A card's firmware boosts its clock as high as it may while there is work, and its
power limiter knocks the clock back each time the draw crosses the limit; on a busy card this happens many times a
second, at the top of the clock range where each extra step of speed costs the most watts. With one wire (the power
limit) a governor can only move the wall the boost pushes against. With two wires, the clock ceiling sets how high the
boost may climb and the power limit becomes a lid that rarely needs to act: the card runs at the bottom of its compass
instead of fighting itself at the top.

**What the card taught us.** Two rules make the difference between saving energy and spending the customer's time.
First, *race while work waits*: when the card is saturated, both wires go to full at once, so a burst is always served
at full speed; the compass paces only the slack between bursts. Second, *never slower than the card on its own*: the
governor learns, from the card's own meter, the clock and the draw the card reaches by itself while busy, and never
sets the clock ceiling or the lid under them. Without these rules the first real card saved 3.5% of its energy and
made the slowest answers 58.5% slower; with them, the modelled card saves energy with the slowest answers at native
speed or faster (section 15, and `docs/GPU_PREREGISTRATION.md`, amendments 6 and 7).

## 7. The Two-Way Nervous System

Every muscle is wired both ways: a sensory wire in (its meters) and a motor wire out (its knob), with the read-back
closing the loop. Between them sits the nervous system (`omnicompass/nervous_system.py`), which decides how much
authority each organ has at each moment:

- **Expand is always allowed** (except under a security hold): adding capacity, power, cooling or protection never
  waits.
- **Contract needs calm and a clean service record:** giving anything back is allowed only while the organ is calm
  enough and service has been inside its line for the last three decisions; continuous organs give back at most the
  calm share of their surplus per decision; discrete organs one unit at a time, through a release gate.
- **Fail up:** while service is breached, the knob returns to native at once.
- **Blind means hold:** if a sense goes stale or unreadable, nothing is given back until it returns.

One brain reads every organ at once. Because one law sets every knob, no two muscles fight: when the GPU's watts turn
to heat, the cooling knob already knows it is coming; when pods scale up, the power envelope is ready.

# PART III - THE HARNESS: PLUGS, WIRES AND THE WIRE CHECK

## 8. The Plug, the Adapters and the Wire Check

Think of a high-end car stereo: one head unit, one standard plug on its back, and an adapter harness for each make of
car that matches the car's factory plug. You never cut a factory wire, and when you pull the stereo, the car works as
it did. Omni-Compass is wired the same way.

**8.1 The plug (one design for every muscle).** Each plug has as many channels as its muscle has knobs. Every channel
declares its cover (range), its direction (which way is "more"), its units and how fast it may move. Every plug keeps
the same contract (`omnicompass/compass_law.py`, `Plug`):

1. **attach** - read the knob once, before any write: the snapshot. It never moves afterwards.
2. **read** - the service reading, into the compass.
3. **write** - one value, clipped to the cover, then read back from the device.
4. **one writer** - if the knob is found at a value Omni-Compass did not write, someone else owns it: Omni-Compass
   stops writing and leaves that value alone.
5. **restore** - on stop, the knob returns to the snapshot (where Omni-Compass found it, not the last value it wrote).
   For muscles whose native controller moves the knob itself, restore hands control back.

**8.2 Adapters (one per standard plug).** Omni-Compass speaks each industry's standard control interface through an
adapter. Status is stated plainly:

| Standard | Muscles | Adapter status |
|---|---|---|
| Kubernetes API | HPAs, deployments, pods, nodes | **built** (`omni_controller/controller.py`, `muscles.py`) |
| NVIDIA NVML / `nvidia-smi` | GPU clock ceiling, power limit | **built** (`omni_controller/gpu_compass.py`, two wires; `gpu_governor.py`, one wire) |
| Linux cpufreq, RAPL | CPU frequency ceiling, package watts | **built** (`--cpufreq-policy-root`, `--rapl-cmd`) |
| Site meter, building controller by command | site watts, supply-air setpoint | **built** (`--power-cmd`, `--cooling-cmd` command templates) |
| Cloud node groups (Karpenter, Cluster Autoscaler, MachineSet) | machines | **built** through `--node-scale-cmd` templates |
| BACnet, Modbus, SNMP | chillers, air handlers, PDUs, UPS | designed; today reached through the command templates above |
| OPC UA, EtherNet/IP, PROFINET, EtherCAT, ROS 2, CAN | PLCs, drives, robots, vehicles | designed; modelled in the realm harness |
| IEC 61850, DNP3, OpenADR, IEEE 2030.5, SunSpec, OCPP | substations, batteries, inverters, chargers | designed; modelled in the realm harness |

The engineer's job for one muscle is three things: which adapter, the address of the knob, and its safe range.

**8.3 Power-up order.** Read-only first; then take the knobs, the least consequential first; on stop, hand them back
in reverse order.

**8.4 The wire check (mandatory before any write).** For the GPU it is one command,
`sudo python3 tools/gpu_wire_check.py --gpu 0`, and `scripts/gpu_rented_run.sh` runs it first and stops if it fails:

| Step | It proves |
|---|---|
| 1 read | every meter answers: watts, temperature, utilization, limit, clock, top clock |
| 2 snapshot | the start limit is recorded once |
| 3 up wire | with the card busy, a ceiling below its own busy clock pulls the clock down under it; reset, the clock comes back above it |
| 4 down wire | a lower power limit is reported back exactly; the start limit is reported back exactly |
| 5 restore | clocks reset and the start limit read back |
| 6 stop | the governor, stopped by its signal, hands both wires back |
| 7 other writer | a limit set by someone else while the governor runs is left alone, and the governor exits 5 |

Any failure prints the wire, the step and what the device said, and nothing else runs. That turns a wiring fault from
guesswork into one named line to fix.

**8.5 Wired right or wired wrong.** The wire check proves the wires move. It does not prove the governor reads the
right thing. A correct installation leaves signatures in its own receipts; a wrong one leaves others. Check them on
your first paired runs, before you believe any number, good or bad.

| Check | Wired right | Wired wrong, and what to look at |
|---|---|---|
| Watch arm against native | equal on every gauge (watch writes nothing) | different: the probe, the load or the machine differs between arms, not Omni |
| Requests served, failed requests | equal to native | fewer served or more failed: a lever is cutting capacity; check its cover and its sign |
| p95 and p99 response time | at native or faster | slower: the reading or the floors are wrong (rows below) |
| GPU: the card's clock while busy | at or above the clock the card reaches on its own | below it: the speed floor is missing or the lid is under the card's own draw |
| GPU: the lid while busy | at or above the card's own busy draw | at the envelope floor while busy: the lid is sized from a curve, not from the card's own meter |
| GPU: credit per write (`GPU_REPS.md`) | compass decisions pace the slack, race decisions cover the bursts; fail-up is rare | fail-up in most decisions: being busy is being read as a breach, or the service line is set too low |
| Kubernetes: machines given back | through the release gate, one per decision, with no pod waiting | machines given back while pods wait, or none at all while the service is far inside its band: check the latency feed, `--slo-ms` and the release gate's reasons in the audit |
| Kubernetes: the reset | every HPA target, replica range, CPU limit and worker back to native, no record left | anything left: an earlier run or another controller wrote the same objects |
| Every lever after the run | at its snapshot | not at its snapshot: another writer, or a restore that failed (exit 3): restore by hand and investigate |
| The feed itself | fresh samples every few seconds | stale or empty: Omni reads it as blind and fails up; fix the feed, not the governor |

**The rule.** If any row reads "wired wrong", the result of that run says nothing about Omni-Compass: fix the wiring,
run the wire check and the watch arm again, and only then compare. The first real card run is the worked example: its
receipts showed the card's busy clock under its own (736-768 MHz against 861-889), the lid at the 105 W floor under its
own 135 W draw, and fail-up in 46% of decisions. Each of those is a row in this table.

# PART IV - WIRING IT ONTO YOUR STACK, STEP BY STEP

## 9. Before You Start, and the Eight Levels

### 9.1 What your system needs

| You run | You need |
|---|---|
| Kubernetes (vanilla, EKS, GKE, AKS, OpenShift/OKD, Rancher, kind) | Kubernetes 1.34 or newer (in-place pod resize); metrics-server (`kubectl top nodes` works); an HPA with a CPU target on each governed service; a readiness probe and a short preStop pause on each service |
| A response-time feed (strongly recommended at every level) | a CSV per service, `elapsed_seconds,latency_ms,ok`, written continuously; `scripts/latency_probe.py` writes one against any HTTP endpoint |
| NVIDIA GPUs | a driver with `nvidia-smi`; root (or the capability to run `nvidia-smi -pl` and `-lgc`); on a VM, full GPU passthrough |
| CPU power control | Linux cpufreq with the schedutil governor; RAPL for package watts; usually bare metal |
| Site power and cooling | a command that prints site watts, and a command that sets the supply-air setpoint through your building management system |

### 9.2 Get the software and check it

```
git clone https://github.com/The-Omni-Compass-LLC/The-Omni-Compass.git
cd The-Omni-Compass
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 verify.py                       # every check; ends with VERIFICATION: PASS
```

Build the container image once:

```
docker build -f deploy/Dockerfile -t <your-registry>/omni-compass:<tag> .
docker push <your-registry>/omni-compass:<tag>
```

It runs as non-root, with a read-only root filesystem and no Linux capabilities.

### 9.3 The levels

Take them in order. Each has a pass condition; go to the next level only when it holds. The OFF switch works at every
level.

**Level 0 - Evaluate without touching anything.**

```
python3 verify.py
python3 tools/run_scale.py --runs 10 --scale 1 --out results/scale/eval     # the six organisms, simulated
python3 tools/run_gpu_card.py results/sim/gpu_two_wire/eval                  # the two-wire card, modelled
```

Pass: `VERIFICATION: PASS`. Nothing in your systems is touched.

**Level 1 - Watch (read-only).**

```
kubectl apply -f deploy/install/omni-compass.yaml     # set the image line; it runs --mode observe
kubectl -n omni-compass logs deploy/omni-compass -f
```

The install file grants a read-only identity; `scripts/pilot_shadow.sh` records `kubectl auth can-i` receipts that
show it cannot write. Every decision it would take is logged with its reason.
Pass: zero writes, and readings your operators agree with.

**Level 2 - The pods, on top of your autoscalers. WRITES.**
1. Grant `patch horizontalpodautoscalers` and `patch pods/resize` (`deploy/rbac-target.yaml`).
2. Run with `--mode target --latency-file <feed> --slo-ms <your p95 target>`.
3. Optional pod muscles, one at a time:

| Muscle | Switch | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| convey | `--latency-file` and `--cap-deployments ns/name` | gives each machine's idle CPU to the serving pods on it |
| rightsize | `--rightsize-deployments ns/name` | each pod's CPU request follows its measured use times (1 + headroom), in place |
| coldstart | `--coldstart-deployments ns/name --coldstart-signal ns/configmap` | scales a service to zero while no work waits, wakes it when work arrives |
| batch | `--batch` | admits held Jobs labelled `omnicompass.io/batch=true` when there is load and power headroom |
| batch pace | `--batch-pace` | pauses Jobs labelled `omnicompass.io/pausable=true` under power or heat stress, resumes them after |
| rollout guard | `--rollout-guard ns/name` | pauses a rollout while change is not permitted |
| contain | `--contain-namespaces ns --contain-cpu-m <m>` | holds an agent namespace to a CPU budget |
| security hold | `--security-configmap ns/name` | key `hold: "true"` blocks every expansion |

Your HPAs keep scaling as before; Omni-Compass sets their targets and raises floors ahead of bursts.
Pass: p95, p99 and failed requests no worse than native, over paired runs (section 13).

**Level 3 - The machines. WRITES.**
1. Grant `patch nodes` and `patch pods` (`deploy/kind/rbac-omni.yaml`).
2. Run with `--mode nodepool --active-nodes-only --closure /app/law/closure.json --node-scale-cmd "<command with {n}>"`
   and `--node-restore-cmd "<command>"` for the OFF switch. For the compass law on the same levers, use `--law compass`
   (reads the mean response time of the latency window between a tenth of `--slo-ms` and `--slo-ms`, held at
   `--compass-center 0.4`; p95 at the SLO, a blind feed or a waiting pod adds capacity at once; the HPA target never goes
   above the operator's; machines go back one at a time through the release gate).

| Your platform | The park/wake command |
|---|---|
| any cluster, bare metal, kind | `bash scripts/kind_nodepool.sh {n}` |
| Karpenter / EKS Auto Mode | the NodePool CPU limit at `{n}` times node CPU, parked nodes kept |
| Cluster Autoscaler node group | the group's desired size, scale-down through parking |
| OpenShift / OKD | the worker MachineSet replicas, parked |

A machine is given back only when every sense is live, the last order landed, pods are not scaling up, nothing waits
for a place, and the remaining machines stay inside the band.
Pass: fewer machines in service, with no service gauge worse.

**Level 4 - Omni-Compass decides; Kubernetes is the muscle. WRITES.** Add `--strict-replicas`: Omni-Compass decides
each service's replica floor and when to shrink; the HPA stays as the fast reflex upward.
Pass: as level 3.

**Level 5 - A GPU box, two wires. WRITES.**

```
sudo python3 tools/gpu_wire_check.py --gpu 0                    # must end: WIRED RIGHT
# watch: computes both wires and writes neither
sudo python3 -m omni_controller.gpu_compass --mode watch --gpus 0 --audit /var/log/omni/gpu.jsonl \
     --latency-file <feed> --slo-ms <p95 target> --floor-w <your lowest watts>
# govern: writes the clock ceiling and the power limit
sudo python3 -m omni_controller.gpu_compass --mode cap --gpus 0 --audit /var/log/omni/gpu.jsonl \
     --latency-file <feed> --slo-ms <p95 target> --floor-w <your lowest watts>
# OFF: clocks reset, power limit back to the start, read back
sudo touch /tmp/omni-gpu-kill
```

Every `--interval` seconds (default 2) it reads the card's own meters and the response times, and:
- **learns the card on its own** first: while the ceiling is at the top and the card is busy, its busy clock and busy
  draw; until 15 such readings are in, neither wire moves;
- **races while work waits**: at 95% utilization or more, the ceiling to the top and the lid to the start limit;
- **paces the slack**: the mean response time of the last 5 s, between a tenth of `--slo-ms` and `--slo-ms`, held at
  the compass's center (0.4); the ceiling moves in whole 15 MHz steps, never under the card's own busy clock, and the lid
  never under the card's own busy draw plus 10%, never over the start limit;
- **asks the card first (the verdict)**: before the ceiling may go one step lower, a paired trial measures the card's own
  time on each request (the workload's `service_ms`) at the top and at that step; the step is allowed only if it adds
  at most `--allow` (2%). Where no step passes, the ceiling stays at the top: the card runs as it does alone, and the
  audit says so (`verdict_state: left native`);
- **fails up** when p95 reaches `--slo-ms`, a request fails, the feed goes blind or the card reports a heat slowdown.

One law, no profiles: down gain 0.0125, center 0.4, floor at the card's own busy clock, allowance 2% (GPU
preregistration, amendment 8). The workload must write `service_ms` (the card's own time per request) in its latency
file, as `tools/gpu_workload.py` does; without it no step is ever allowed and the card stays native.
Pass: work per energy up or equal; requests served equal; no request more than 2% slower at the median, p95 and p99
at native or within 2%; every row of section 8.5 reads "wired right".

**Level 6 - CPU clock and power. WRITES.** On bare metal, add to the controller:
`--cpufreq-policy-root /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq --cpufreq-require-schedutil --rapl-cmd "<prints CPU package watts>"`.
The OFF switch writes every policy's recorded maximum back exactly.
Pass: energy per unit of work down, no service gauge worse.

**Level 7 - Site power and cooling. WRITES.**
`--power-cmd "<prints site watts>" --site-limit-w <limit>` brings site power stress into the engine;
`--cooling-cmd "<sets {c}>" --cooling-min-c 18 --cooling-max-c 27 --cooling-restore-c 22` lets it hold the supply-air
setpoint in its band. CPU and GPU sharing one power budget (`hardware/node_exchange.py`) and GPU groups sharing a site
budget (`hardware/site_exchange.py`) run in simulation today. Batteries are designed as an organ, not yet wired.

## 10. Stack by Stack

| Stack | Levels | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Vanilla Kubernetes, kind, Rancher | 1-7 | as written |
| Amazon EKS | 1-5 | machines via Cluster Autoscaler node group or Karpenter; CPU power control is not exposed on EC2 VMs; GPUs on bare-metal or full-GPU instances |
| Google GKE, Azure AKS | 1-5 | the provider's node-pool size as the park/wake command |
| Red Hat OpenShift / OKD | 1-5 | the same permissions through a Role; machines via the worker MachineSet |
| NVIDIA GPU servers without Kubernetes | 5 | the two-wire GPU governor alone |
| Bare-metal CPU servers | 6 | cpufreq and RAPL through sysfs |
| Slurm / HPC | 5 on the GPU nodes | a job-level Slurm connector is not built |
| Building management | 7 | through your BMS's command line or API, in the command templates |

# PART V - OPERATING IT

## 11. The OFF Switch, the Rules, and the Log

**The rules Omni-Compass keeps on your system.**
1. **The master switch, for the whole harness, in a human hand:** `python3 tools/omni_switch.py off` turns every
   Omni-Compass governor on the machine off at once (the Kubernetes controller and the GPU governors). Each puts every
   setting it ever wrote back to the value it read before its first write, reads it back and exits; the command waits
   until all have, and says so. While the switch is OFF, no governor will start. `python3 tools/omni_switch.py on` allows
   them to be started again (nothing restarts by itself); `status` shows the switch and every governor running. Use it
   the moment anything looks wrong, including a suspected breach. Each governor also keeps its own switch for one
   muscle at a time: the kill file (or `OMNI_KILL=1`, or SIGTERM to the GPU governor).
   **If a governor dies without handing back** (killed outright, the machine crashed, it hung), nothing it wrote is
   left in place: every governor records, before its first write, the exact commands that put every setting back, and
   renews a lease every decision. Run `python3 tools/omni_switch.py watchdog` as its own service next to the governors:
   it hands back for any governor whose process is gone or whose lease has run out (a hung one is stopped first).
   `status` names any governor that died without handing back.
2. It records before it acts (annotations on Kubernetes objects; the `snapshot` line in the GPU audit).
3. It watches before it writes.
4. It never acts blind.
5. Service first: while response time is over its target, and for `--slo-clear` decisions after, nothing is given back.
6. Every change is read back; no new order goes on top of one that has not landed.
7. The living band and the cover: no organ is driven outside its range; machines are parked, never switched off by
   Omni-Compass; it never evicts or moves a pod.
8. One writer: if anyone else changes a knob, Omni-Compass stops writing it and leaves it alone.
9. Everything is logged: every read, decision, write and reason goes to the audit log.

**Reading the log.**

| Line | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `gate: a sense is blind` | a reading failed; nothing is given back until it returns |
| `gate: pods scaling up` | pods first, machines after |
| `decision failed (n in a row)` | the cluster could not be reached; nothing was written; turn it OFF for native |
| `decided_by: compass` | the compass set the wires this decision |
| `decided_by: fail_up` / `blind_fail_up` | the service crossed the 0.95 wall, or a sense went blind: full capacity at once |
| `decided_by: thermal_hold` | the card reported a heat slowdown; nothing was tightened |
| `foreign_writer` | someone else changed a knob; Omni-Compass now observes only |
| `restored ... ok: true` | the OFF switch put every setting back and read it back |

## 12. Maintenance, Upgrades and Security

- Run `python3 verify.py` after every upgrade; it must end `VERIFICATION: PASS`.
- Upgrade in watch mode first; take the levels again from level 1.
- The container runs non-root, read-only, with no capabilities; the Kubernetes identity has only the permissions of
  the level you run.
- The GPU governor needs root only for `nvidia-smi -pl` and `-lgc`.
- Report a security issue as `SECURITY.md` describes.

---

# PART VI - PROVING IT

## 13. Paired Runs and Receipts on Your Own System

1. **Paired runs.** Run your service the same way twice, once native and once with Omni-Compass on top, back to back
   on the same machines, the order rotated, at least 5 times (10 for a result you publish). `scripts/kind_paired.sh`
   and `tools/live_reps.py` do this on Kubernetes; `scripts/gpu_rented_run.sh` does it on a GPU box, in one command:
   wire check, smoke, the six organisms with the card inside, then the preregistered confirmation.
2. **The switch drill** after every run: turn Omni-Compass OFF; confirm every setting is back at its recorded
   original; turn it ON.
3. **The receipt.** Each gauge: native, Omni-Compass, the change, the 95% interval of the difference, and whether the
   interval excludes zero. A change is proven only when it does.
4. **The label, by rule written before the run:** SUPERIOR WITHIN GUARDRAILS / ENERGY IMPROVEMENT WITH SERVICE
   TRADEOFF / NONINFERIOR / NOT ESTABLISHED / WORSE / INVALID. Guardrails: work not lower by more than 1%; the share of
   time outside the service line not higher by more than 1 percentage point. The band-first rule is stricter: no win
   is claimed while the time outside the service line is above native's.

**At scale (simulated).** The six organisms run on GitHub's machines (Actions, workflow `six`) or on any machine
(`bash scripts/scale_ladder.sh`) at 1, 10, 100 and 1,000 paired runs and at 1, 10, 100 and 1,000 copies of each
organism on one clock. Real Kubernetes runs on GitHub's machines (workflow `benchmark-reps`).

## 14. Evidence Classes and How to Read a Result

| Class | Rung | What it is | What it can show |
|---|---|---|---|
| T / V | E1 | deterministic tests, proofs, Python against the C++ twin | the law is what it says, and both languages agree |
| S | E2 | simulation on a modelled plant | whether the law helps the model, and where it breaks |
| L | E3 | real software (Kubernetes on kind), no hardware meter | real decisions on real software; energy there is a declared model |
| P | E4 | a physical meter (the GPU's own power reading) | the hardware's own answer |

Read every number with its class beside it. A simulation number is never quoted as a hardware result. When a
receipt's energy line is modelled, the receipt says so.

## 15. Results to Date

Every result below is Omni-Compass **on top of** a native system against the same native system alone, with the same
work in both arms. "Nothing worse" means no measure significantly worse than native beyond the one 2% rule.

| Result | Class | Source |
|---|---|---|
| **Real Kubernetes, set 31** (10 paired runs, fixed-rate load): the compass law with the verdict, machines −10.4%, p95 −66.0%, p99 −73.0%, time over the line −99.4%, HPA replicas −44.5%, pods started 0 against native's 4.3, total CPU including Omni-Compass's own −6.1%, failed requests 0; the allocation law, machines −32.2%, p95 −61.4%, total CPU −6.6%. Nothing worse in either arm | L | `results/live/LIVE_REPS_31.md` |
| **Real Kubernetes, the fault test, set 31 F** (a machine lost, traffic tripled, a runaway pod, the probe blind, at the same moments in every arm): recovery faster than native from every fault (compass law: machine down −49%, runaway pod −18%, spike −8%), p95 −62.6%, failed requests −16.4%, HPA replicas −1.1% (not significant). Nothing significantly worse; the p99 under faults reads higher with intervals far across zero | L | `results/live/FAULTS_31.md` (earlier runs: `FAULTS.md`, `FAULTS_30.md`, and the two fixes between them in `docs/K8S_COMPASS_PREREGISTRATION.md`) |
| **The cost to match**: native tuned harder by its operator (HPA target 40, 30, 20: more pods) never reached Omni-Compass's p95 (best native 346.6 ms against 123.5 ms compass, 149.4 ms allocation law), with fewer pods and fewer machines on top | L | `results/live/COST_TO_MATCH.md` |
| Real Kubernetes, sets 29 and 30: the controller reading through one proxy (Omni-Compass's own CPU 0.063 → 0.011 cores), the compass law's total CPU −4.7% and −6.5%, nothing worse | L | `results/live/LIVE_REPS_29.md`, `LIVE_REPS_30.md` |
| **Scale**: the controller governing 50, 500 and 1,000 simulated nodes (KWOK), decision time and correctness | L | `results/scale/` (kwok-scale) |
| **Six organisms, 1x to 1,000x clusters** (up to 1.2 million plants on one clock), 84 of 90 cells: energy lower in every cell (−0.08% to −0.19%), time over the service line lower in 83 of 84 (the one exception a single run at +0.001 points, lower over 10, 100 and 1,000 runs), work cost at most 0.007%, every knob handed back; every cell of 10 runs or more labelled SUPERIOR WITHIN GUARDRAILS. The 100-run cells at 1,000 copies are running on one rented machine | S | `results/scale/GRID.md`, `results/scale/receipts/` |
| Modelled GPU card, the firmware alone against the firmware with Omni-Compass on top (the verdict, 2% allowance): compute-bound energy −0.70% / −0.48%, AI token generation energy −3.25% / −3.72%, both wires restored every run | S | `results/sim/gpu_two_wire/` |
| **Real GPU (NVIDIA A10), the corrected law** (the verdict, steady under the limit): the preregistered confirmations (compute and AI token generation), the operator's power cap at usual and full load, the fault drill, the six organisms with the card inside and real AI serving, running now; the 8-card server run is built (`scripts/gpu_8card.sh`) | P | `docs/GPU_PREREGISTRATION.md` (amendments 8 to 10) |
| Real GPU (NVIDIA A10), the first law (history): work per energy +3.6% (proven), energy −3.5%, but p95 +58.5% worse, so the label by rule was energy improvement with service tradeoff. That law was replaced; the cause and the fix are in amendments 6 to 8 | P | `results/gpu/run-20261002T082232Z/GPU_REPS.md` |
| Earlier Kubernetes sets 23 to 28 (before the verdict, the proxy and the fault fixes) stay as they ran | L | `results/live/LIVE_REPS_23.md` to `LIVE_REPS_28.md` |

Still to come, each built and preregistered: the bill on a real cloud (`.github/workflows/aks-metered.yml`,
`docs/AZURE_SETUP.md`), the capacity test (`docs/K8S_COMPASS_PREREGISTRATION.md`), the real-card results above and the
8-card run.

---|---|---|
| Real Kubernetes, set 27 (10 paired runs, the compass law aligned with the GPU governor): machines -15.9%, p95 -65.5%, failed requests 0, better on machines within the band; set 26 (10 paired runs, three arms): the allocation law machines -35.8%, p95 -55.4%; the compass law machines -17.2%, p95 -64.8%, failed requests 0, better on machines within the band by its preregistered rule; set 25: machines -32.3%, p95 -57.3% | L | `results/live/LIVE_REPS_25.md`, `results/live/LIVE_REPS_26.md`, `results/live/LIVE_REPS_27.md` |
| Real Kubernetes, set 24 (10 paired runs): machines in service -31.6%, p95 response -60.1%, p99 -64.1%, HPA replicas -38.6%, failed requests 0 on both, total CPU including Omni-Compass's own -1.8% (not significant) | L | `results/live/LIVE_REPS_24.md` (GitHub run 36983865216) |
| Real Kubernetes, set 23 (10 paired runs): p95 -62.2%, replicas -36.6%, machines in service -28.7%, failed requests 0 | L | `results/live/LIVE_REPS_23.md` |
| Modelled GPU card, the card's firmware alone against the firmware with Omni on top (the verdict, 2% allowance), tuning / fresh seeds: compute-bound work, energy -0.70% / -0.48%, median +1.56% / +1.47%, p95 and p99 unchanged within their intervals; AI token generation, energy -3.25% / -3.72%, median +0.55% / +0.70%, p95 +0.29% / +0.26%; both wires restored every run | S | `results/sim/gpu_two_wire/` |
| Six organisms, 1,000 paired runs each at 1x and at 10x size: work per energy +0.30% / +0.29% (compute), +0.23% / +0.22% (physics), +0.21% / +0.20% (energy), +0.25% / +0.24% (distribution), +0.21% / +0.21% (four stacked), +0.22% / +0.22% (whole tower); every knob handed back; time over the service line +0.19 to +0.27 points above native in every cell, so the band-first rule is not yet met. 100x and 1,000x running | S | `results/scale/GRID.md` |
| Real GPU (NVIDIA A10), first confirmation, 10 paired runs, the card's own meter: work per energy +3.6% (proven), energy -3.5%, same requests, none lost, every write read back and restored; p95 response +58.5% worse, so the label by rule is energy improvement with service tradeoff. The cause was governor wiring, corrected (amendments 6-8); the corrected governor is next on a card | P | `results/gpu/run-20261002T082232Z/GPU_REPS.md` |

## 17. Python, C++ and the Seal

The laws are twinned: each has a Python version and a C++20 version that give the same answers, proven by a parity
test on every build (`cmake -S cpp -B cpp/build && cmake --build cpp/build`).

| Law | Python | C++ | Proven by |
|---|---|---|---|
| core engine | `omnicompass/core.py` | `cpp/src/core.cpp` | 500 frozen fixtures |
| governor | `omnicompass/adapter.py` | `cpp/src/governor.cpp` | `tests/test_cpp_governor_parity.py` |
| safety shield | `omnicompass/shield.py` | `cpp/src/shield.cpp` | `tests/test_cpp_shield_parity.py` |

| closure law | `omnicompass/closure.py` | `cpp/src/closure.cpp` | `tests/test_cpp_closure_parity.py` |
| conveyance law | `omnicompass/conveyance.py` | `cpp/src/conveyance.cpp` | `tests/test_cpp_conveyance_parity.py` |
| nervous system | `omnicompass/nervous_system.py` | `cpp/src/nervous_system.cpp` | `tests/test_cpp_twins_parity.py` |
| compass and ledger | `omnicompass/compass.py`, `storage.py` | `cpp/src/compass.cpp` | `tests/test_cpp_twins_parity.py` |
| GPU governor rules | `omni_controller/gpu_governor.py` | `cpp/src/gpu_rules.cpp` | `tests/test_cpp_twins_parity.py` |

The seal (`results/SEAL.json`) holds the SHA-256 fingerprint of every twinned file, written only after every parity
test passes. `verify.py` fails, naming the file, if any sealed file changes afterwards. The compass law
(`omnicompass/compass_law.py`) and the two-wire GPU governor are in Python today; their C++ twins are next.

## Appendix C - The Equations in Full

    (1) dE/dt    = -alpha_E E + beta_int + beta_ext + v_eff
    (2) dU/dt    = mu U (1 - U^2) - (dE/dt)/E_max - lambda_U U + u,   |u| <= U_AUTHORITY = 25
    (3) dI_U/dt  = (1 - U) - sigma_1 E - delta S - lambda_I I_U
    (4) v_eff    = cos(omega_B t / 2) * c * tanh(lambda_0 + lambda_1 (U - 0.5) + lambda_2 S)
    (5) Phi(S)   = alpha_s S^2 / 2 + beta_s S^3 / 4 - delta S
    (6) dS/dt    = -dPhi/dS = delta - alpha_s S - (3/4) beta_s S^2
    (7) dB/dt    = B_dot ;  dB_dot/dt = gamma_c delta S - (omega_B / Q_B) B_dot - omega_B^2 B
    (8) R_B[n]   = finite-difference audit of (7); never fed back into the state

    Control (one micro step, zero-order hold across all four RK4 stages):
        u = clip(-f_U(x, t) + K_P (sigma - U), -U_AUTHORITY, +U_AUTHORITY),  K_P = 12,  sigma in {-1, +1}

    The compass (every muscle):
        p = position of the service reading in its band (0 calm, 1 the line)
        F = A tanh((K_P (p - center) + K_D v) / A),   K_D >= critical damping
        p >= 0.95  =>  full up force; down side held
        knob <- clip(knob + g_side F span, cover)

    The GPU governor (two wires, omni_controller/gpu_compass.py; one law, amendments 8 to 10):
        p = (mean response of the last 5 s - S) / (SLO - S),  S = SLO / 10;  p95 >= SLO, a failure, blind  =>  fail up
        fail up / race (utilization >= 0.95)  =>  ceiling = top clock, lid = start limit (the card's own settings)
        steady under the limit (saturated and drawing >= 0.97 of the limit)  =>  ceiling = the card's own busy clock,
            lid = start limit (the same watts, no knock-backs)
        otherwise:
            ceiling <- clip(ceiling + round(g_side F f_top / 15 MHz) 15 MHz, c_floor, f_top)
            c_floor = max(f_busy_own x floor, f_top - k* 15 MHz)       (never under the card's own busy clock,
                                                                         never past the verdict's deepest step k*)
            lid = clip(ceil(1.10 P_busy_own), envelope floor, start limit)
        g_up 0.10, g_down 0.0125, center 0.4, floor 1.00

    The verdict (omnicompass/verdict.py; every slow knob, the GPU ceiling and the Kubernetes machine count):
        reference r = the median cost per request at the deepest allowed step, measured fresh, n >= 30 requests
        trial t     = the median cost at one step past it, n >= 30 requests, under the same traffic
        allow the step  iff  t <= r (1 + a)  and  t <= c_native (1 + a),   a = 0.02
        a refused step is not tried again for R decisions (GPU R = 900; Kubernetes 120); the knob never goes past the
        deepest allowed step, so steps cannot add up beyond the allowance

    Kubernetes, the compass on the HPA target (omni_controller/controller.py; sets 30 and 31):
        target x in [0.6 x_op, x_op] (times the conveyed gain); the up force lowers x (more pods)
        p >= 0.95 from load (line breached, every sense live, nothing pending)  =>  x = 0.6 x_op at once
        p >= 0.95 from a blind sense or pods waiting for a lost machine           =>  x = x_op (native's own)
        fault over (p < center, line clean, nothing pending)                      =>  x = x_op at once, never held
        machines: one more at once past the wall; one back only when the verdict and the release gate agree
        g_up 0.10, g_down 0.02, release force < -0.2

    The productivity arithmetic (every receipt; manual section 3.4):
        work W equal in both arms;  G = C_native / C_omni - 1;  the same work needs 1/(1 + G) of the resources;
        saving S = G / (1 + G):  G = 1/3  <=>  S = 1/4

## Appendix E - Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Wire check `FAIL 3 up wire (lock)` | the driver or VM refuses clock locking | use bare metal or full passthrough; or run the one-wire governor |
| Wire check `FAIL 3 up wire (follows down)` | the card ignores the ceiling | update the driver; check for another management agent holding clocks |
| Wire check `FAIL 4 down wire` | the power limit is refused or capped by the board | check `nvidia-smi -q -d POWER`; run as root |
| `another copy of this test is already running` | a second copy was started | wait for the first or reboot; start once |
| `something else is using the GPU` | another process holds the card | stop it; the benchmark must run alone |
| Governor exit 5 | another writer changed a knob | find the other controller; Omni-Compass left its value alone |
| Governor exit 3 | a restore did not read back | restore by hand (`nvidia-smi -rgc`, `-pl <start>`); investigate before rerunning |
| `decision failed (n in a row)` | the cluster API is unreachable | turn it OFF; native runs on |
| Energy saved but p95 slower than native | the card served bursts below its own clock, or the lid sat under its own draw | read section 8.5; in the audit compare `telemetry.clock_mhz` while busy with `native_busy_clock_mhz`, and `want_w` with `native_busy_draw_w` |
| Fail-up in most decisions | `--slo-ms` set too low for the workload, or a stale feed read as blind | set `--slo-ms` from the workload's own target; check the feed's age |
| No saving at all, service unchanged | the card is saturated almost all the time (it races), or the service sits above the compass's center | expected on a card with no slack; the saving comes from the quiet stretches |
| Kubernetes: no machine ever given back | the release gate refuses (its reason is in the audit), or the service is above the compass's center | read `node_gate.reason` in the audit; check `--slo-ms` and the latency feed |
