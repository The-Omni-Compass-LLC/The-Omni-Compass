One engine runs Omni-Compass, and every result in this repository comes from it. This page names it, gives its
equations exactly as the code computes them, and names every other form as a variant. Where any document, manual, chart
or filing states the equations differently, this page and the file it fingerprints are what the software runs.

## 1. The canonical engine: `symmetric_verified`

| | |
|---|---|
| Name | `symmetric_verified` (`omnicompass/configurations.py`, `DEFAULT`) |
| Code | `omnicompass/core.py` (Python), `cpp/src/core.cpp` (C++ twin, sealed in `results/SEAL.json`) |
| Fingerprint | SHA-256 of `omnicompass/core.py`, recorded in `results/PREREGISTRATION.json` and `RELEASE_MANIFEST.json`; checked by `verify.py` |
| Evidence | every simulation, benchmark, live Kubernetes run and GPU harness in this repository |

State: E (deviation), U (coherence), I_U (unmet-need integral), S (structural stress), B and B_dot (the bath).

```
v_eff  = cos(omega_B t / 2) · c · tanh(lambda_0 + lambda_1 (U − 0.5) + lambda_2 S)        (spinor closure, 720°)
dE/dt  = −alpha_E E + beta_int + beta_ext + v_eff
dU/dt  = mu U (1 − U²) − (dE/dt) / E_max − lambda_U U + u                                 (symmetric double well)
dI_U/dt = (1 − U) − sigma_1 E − delta S − lambda_I I_U
dS/dt  = delta − alpha_s S − (3/4) beta_s S²                                               (gradient of Phi)
dB/dt  = B_dot
dB_dot/dt = gamma_c delta S − (omega_B / Q_B) B_dot − omega_B² B
Phi(S) = alpha_s S² / 2 + beta_s S³ / 4 − delta S
```
u is the controller's command, `KP (target − U) − drift`, bounded by `U_AUTHORITY`; integration is RK4 with the
macro and micro steps of `omnicompass/core.py`.

### Mechanism identity

`results/MECHANISM_IDENTITY.json` (`tools/mechanism_identity.py`) fingerprints the mechanism
M = (F, Theta, C, h, G, M_act, dt, A) component by component: state law, parameters, controller, observation map,
authority law, actuator map, execution timing, shield. `verify.py` fails if any component changes without the record
being rewritten. Every evidence claim names the mechanism id that produced it; "the eight-line engine" alone names none.

| Configuration | Mechanism id | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `symmetric_verified` | `29d9808dfb8f626ad5de17a8a1efa37411dbab08a64af4b276143b466f7ce21c` | canonical |
| `printed_eight_line` | `cd333dc166fb7684ec0fca71f5f50488041e47825ee47d1ea667bec1f3d2259d` | named alternative embodiment |

On the frozen 500-fixture population (`benchmarks/core_evidence.py`, seed 223387268), both are executable and neither
is a stand-in for the other:

| | finite | CONVEY-5 | CERT-10 | mean final target error | mean integrated abs(u) | max abs(u) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `symmetric_verified` | 500/500 | 500/500 | 500/500 | 7.48e-5 | 0.878 | 13.93 |
| `printed_eight_line` | 500/500 | 500/500 | 500/500 | 5.13e-6 | 11.79 | 18.87 |

The printed form reaches its target more tightly with about 13 times the control effort. The structure is Option A:
one canonical configuration, one named alternative; no equivalence is claimed.

## 2. Variants

### `printed_eight_line` (the printed chart)
Implemented in `omnicompass/configurations.py`, checked against the printed plate (`tests/test_engine_configurations.py`),
**not benchmarked**: no result in this repository comes from it.

```
v_eff  = c · tanh(lambda_0 + lambda_1 (U − U_t) + lambda_2 S)                             (no spinor factor)
dE/dt  = −alpha E + beta_int + beta_ext + v_eff
dU/dt  = alpha (1 − U) − (dE/dt) / E_max − k U (1 − U) + u                                 (logistic)
dI_U/dt = (1 − U) − sigma_1 E − delta S                                                    (no lambda_I term)
dS/dt, dB/dt, dB_dot/dt as in section 1
```

Differences from the canonical engine: logistic U instead of the symmetric double well; no spinor factor; a general
target U_t; no lambda_I damping; alpha in place of alpha_E. alpha_U and k enter the printed form; they do not enter the
canonical engine.

## 3. What would change this declaration

Promoting a variant to canonical needs, in one commit: the variant run through every harness beside the canonical
engine, its results reported next to the canonical results, this page and `RELEASE_MANIFEST.json` updated, and the
preregistration amended on record (`results/LOCK_AMENDMENTS.json`). Until then the canonical engine is
`symmetric_verified`.

## 4. Open mathematical items (from `docs/FORMAL_STATUS.md` and the handoff)

- A global stability proof of the forced six-state system is not closed. What is held on the U channel is proved in
  `docs/TRACKING_THEOREM.md`: unsaturated exponential tracking; the saturated case under a drift bound that holds over
  the declared box (F_bar = 16.86 < 25); the sampled-data bound of the executed RK4 controller; admissibility.
- Candidate routes: the Unified Circle Principle on a region; Theorem 5.6 of the Closed Structure, if its core maps onto
  (E, U, I_U, S, B).

## 5. For filings

Which form a patent or copyright filing claims as the principal embodiment is a decision for The Omni-Compass LLC and
its counsel. Whatever that decision, the software described by this repository runs the canonical engine of section 1,
and a filing that claims the printed form should name `symmetric_verified` as the embodiment that has been implemented
and tested, or the printed form should be benchmarked first (section 3).
