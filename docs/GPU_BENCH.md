If your paired receipts differ from the published benchmarks in direction, the first presumption is wiring: confirm the installation with section 8.5 of the manual (*Wired right or wired wrong*).

This is the test that answers "does Omni-Compass save real energy?" with the GPU's own power meter. There is no model
in it. Nobody has run it yet on real hardware for this repository; the first run is the first real-meter result.

## What you need

- A Linux machine with one NVIDIA GPU (a rented cloud GPU works: A100, H100, L4, A10, RTX), the NVIDIA driver and
  `nvidia-smi`.
- Python 3 with PyTorch built for CUDA (`pip install torch numpy`).
- Root, because setting a GPU power limit (`nvidia-smi -pl`) needs it. Persistence mode on is recommended
  (`sudo nvidia-smi -pm 1`); the receipt records it either way.

## Run it

```bash
git clone <this repository> && cd <it>
sudo bash scripts/gpu_paired.sh                       # 5 repetitions, 10 minutes per arm: about 3 hours
sudo REPS=5 DURATION=300 bash scripts/gpu_paired.sh   # 5-minute arms: about 1.5 hours
```

Options (environment variables): `REPS`, `DURATION` (s per arm), `DRAIN` (s after arrivals stop), `COOLDOWN` (s idle
before each arm), `GPU` (index), `SAMPLE_MS`, `INTERVAL` (s between Omni decisions), `SLO_MS` (response-time target;
default ten bare service times), `WORKLOAD_ARGS` (e.g. `--n 8192 --target-ms 80`).

## Two phases

- `PHASE=smoke` (the default): look for faults and for an effect worth confirming. Any number of repetitions.
- `PHASE=confirm`: the preregistered test (`docs/GPU_PREREGISTRATION.md`), 10 repetitions. Omni's code must be
  committed; its files are hashed before the first arm and again after the last, and any change invalidates the run.

```bash
sudo PHASE=confirm bash scripts/gpu_paired.sh
```

The **primary outcome** is work per energy: requests served per kilojoule the GPU drew.

## What it does

1. **Receipt.** GPU name, UUID, VBIOS, driver, kernel, host, persistence mode, power management, the enforced limit,
   default, minimum, maximum and current power limit, the workload's hash, the mechanism id, git commit
   (`receipt.json`). The current power limit is the **snapshot**; every arm must start and end at it. The bench
   refuses to start unless power management is Enabled (otherwise a written limit would not bind).
2. **Calibrate once.** The workload times its request at the snapshot limit and picks the request size so one request
   takes about 50 ms (`calib.json`). Every arm uses the same calibration.
3. **Three arms per repetition, order rotated,** each after `COOLDOWN` s idle:
   - **native**: no Omni process.
   - **watch**: Omni runs, reads the GPU and decides, and is forbidden to write. This is the control: it shows what
     the machine does with Omni present and silent. If it writes even once, the run is invalid.
   - **omni**: Omni writes the GPU power limit.
4. **The same work in every arm.** `tools/gpu_workload.py` sends one seeded stream of requests (fp16 matrix products)
   at 30%, 60%, 80%, 30%, 60% and 30% of the GPU's full-power capacity. Every arm gets the same requests at the same
   moments.
5. **Measured by the device.** `nvidia-smi` samples power draw, temperature, utilisation, the power limit, the
   **enforced** power limit and the clock-limit reasons every 200 ms for the whole arm (the fields the driver reports,
   listed in `smi_fields.txt`); RAPL CPU package counters are read at both ends where the machine has them. This is
   receipt C, the outcome: Omni never supplies it.
6. **Reset.** After the omni arm Omni restores the snapshot limit and reads it back. The script checks the limit
   after every arm.
7. **The table** (`GPU_REPS.md`): each gauge for native, watch and omni, and three paired contrasts with 95%
   intervals — observation (watch − native), authority (omni − watch), total (omni − native). If an interval includes
   zero, it says **not proven**. The result label is chosen by rule (`docs/GPU_PREREGISTRATION.md`, amendment 1):
   SUPERIOR WITHIN GUARDRAILS, ENERGY IMPROVEMENT WITH SERVICE TRADEOFF, NONINFERIOR / INCONCLUSIVE, NOT ESTABLISHED,
   WORSE, or INVALID. Also: actuator fidelity (receipt B), control effort and representation fidelity (receipt A). A
   meter that was not fitted prints UNAVAILABLE. The run folder holds every raw file and `SHA256SUMS.txt`.

## What Omni does on the GPU (omni_controller/gpu_governor.py)

Every 2 s it reads the GPU and runs the Omni-Compass engine (the throughput law in `omnicompass/adapter.py`): load is
GPU utilisation, power stress is draw over the snapshot limit, heat is temperature over 83 C, queue is response-time
pressure. The engine's power cap becomes a power limit, inside hard rules:

- never below the GPU's current draw x 1.3, never below 0.70 of the snapshot (`--min-share`), never below the device
  minimum, never above the snapshot;
- a busy card (utilisation smoothed over decisions at or over 0.5, `--util-gate`) gets the snapshot limit back at once,
  and the cap returns only under 0.4;
- optional speed lock (`--baseline-file`, from `tools/gpu_baseline.py` on runs without Omni): the limit follows
  response time against that baseline, every gauge kept at least 1% faster (`docs/INTEGRATION_MANUAL.md`, level 5);
- no new write until the last one reads back from the device; every write is read back at once and recorded
  (requested, return code, read back, enforced limit, delay); the engine senses the enforced limit, the one the card
  obeys; a write the device refuses ends the arm (exit 4) and makes the run invalid; no clock locks are ever written;
- if it cannot read the GPU or the response times, the snapshot limit at once;
- if response time breaks its target, the snapshot limit at once, and for three decisions after;
- kill file or SIGTERM: the snapshot limit, read back.

- **one writer:** if the limit ever reads a value Omni did not write, Omni stops writing, leaves that limit alone,
  and exits 5 (the run is invalid);
- **heat fails up:** while the card reports a thermal or hardware slowdown, no lower limit is written;
- every decision names every rule that held the engine back (`blocked_by`) and the one that decided (`decided_by`).

Any workload plugs in through `WORKLOAD_CMD` (for example a vLLM or MLPerf inference harness), if it writes
`latency.csv`, `requests.csv` and `summary.json` in `tools/gpu_workload.py`'s format and `SLO_MS` is given.

The table also credits each write: joules and requests against native at the same moments of the same stream, grouped
by the rule that decided it. CPU energy comes from RAPL by domain: package and DRAM apart, psys never added, wrap
undone. The card's own energy counter (NVML) and its ECC and retired-page counters are read at both ends of each arm.

## Gauges

| Gauge | From | Better |
|---|---|---|
| **work per energy (served requests per kJ), primary** | requests served / GPU energy | higher |
| energy, GPU (J) | power.draw integrated over the arm's window | lower |
| energy per served request (J) | the same, over requests served | lower |
| power, GPU mean (W) | energy / window | lower |
| requests served, not served | the workload's own record | more served, fewer not |
| response time mean, 95th, 99th percentile (ms) | arrival to finish of each request | lower |
| temperature, peak and mean (C) | temperature.gpu | lower |
| energy, CPU package (J) | RAPL counters, when present | lower |

## Testing the bench without a GPU

`python tests/test_gpu_bench.py` runs the whole script against a stand-in `nvidia-smi` (`tests/fake_gpu/`), with the
workload's `--sim` mode. The stand-in has no real power physics, so its numbers mean nothing; it proves the script,
the controls and the validity checks work.
