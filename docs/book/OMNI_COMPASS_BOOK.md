## Foreword


I built Omni-Compass to sit on top of what already exists. Kubernetes, the GPU driver, the building controller, the
battery inverter, the robot's servo loop: those are muscles, and they are good muscles. What none of them has is one
brain that reads all of them at once, holds each of them in the middle of its safe range, and puts every setting back
exactly where it found it when it stops. That brain is Omni-Compass.

This manual is the whole of it: what the governor is, the mathematics it runs on, how its nervous system reads and
writes, how it is wired to each kind of machine, how to turn it on one level at a time, how to switch it off, and how
to prove on your own system what it does. Keep it with the code. When the code changes, this manual changes in the same
commit.

**On this edition.** This edition is written for the referee and the underwriter as much as for the engineer. Every
result in it was run three separate times on a frozen, fingerprinted engine, under rules written before the first run, and
is reported with every loss beside every gain. Where a number is from a model it says so; where a test could not see an
effect it says so; where something has not been shown it says so, in its own section. The questions a careful reader will
ask are asked here first, in section 3.5 beside each result and in section 16.7 as a list, and answered where an answer
exists. Nothing in this manual asks to be believed on our word: every table names the runs it was made from, every run's
raw files are in the repository, and every table can be rebuilt from them by the tool it names.

## Executive Summary


**What it is.** Omni-Compass is a supervisory governor. It sits on top of the controller a system already has, the
Kubernetes autoscaler, the GPU's firmware, the cooling loop, the battery inverter, the robot's servo, the grid's tap
changer, the database's connection pooler, the message broker's consumer group, the cache's memory ceiling, and it moves
only the settings those controllers already accept. It reads each muscle's own meter, computes one bounded force per
muscle from a single smooth law, and holds the service in the middle of its safe band rather than far below its limit.
The native controller keeps running exactly as shipped; Omni-Compass sets what it already exposes, and when Omni-Compass
stops, every setting goes back to the value it read once before its first write. It is never standalone and it never
competes with the controller underneath it.

**What it does for you.** Every running system keeps room "just in case": machines sized for the worst minute of the
day, a pool of connections held open for a load that comes once an hour, a consumer group sized for the quiet hours and
then overrun at the peak, a cache ceiling set once and left. Omni-Compass turns that room into one of two things, and the
operator chooses which: more work for the same resources, or the same work for fewer. The two are the same measurement
read from two sides (section 3.4): a third more work from what is already installed is a quarter off the bill.

**What has been shown, on the frozen engine Omni v3, three separate times each.** On real Kubernetes, six preregistered
tests of ten paired runs each (`results/live/V3_*.md`): work inside the response line **+35% to +49%** in every run of the
all-four test, the 95th-percentile response time **47% to 66% faster** across the steady, wandering, all-four and fault
tests, failed requests 9% to 14% fewer where load swings, machines 1.5% to 2.9% fewer at steady load and 19% to 23%
fewer on a queue of batch jobs, and beside a noisy neighbour no difference beyond the noise on any row. On a real
database behind its pooler (`results/live/V3_PGBENCH.md`): 61% to 72% fewer connections held open for the same work and
the same latency on two of three workloads, at a confirmed cost of 14% to 28% more CPU on the host, counted against
Omni-Compass. On a real message broker, Apache Kafka as shipped (`results/live/V3_KAFKA.md`): 16% to 21% more messages
inside the 500 ms line on all three untouched workloads, a 95th percentile of 9 to 14 ms against native's 1.6 s, no
message lost, at the confirmed cost of three to four times the consumers running. On a real cache, Redis as shipped
(`results/live/V3_REDIS.md`): 14% to 27% more requests inside the 2 ms line and a hit rate 14% to 27% higher on all three
untouched workloads, at the confirmed cost of a memory ceiling held at 200 to 270 MB against the operator's 64 MB, which
outweighs the gain in the index. In the modelled realms, 945 muscles
and six organisms (`results/realms/REALMS.md`): every organism superior within its guardrails, zero muscles worse, at
every size from 1 to 1,000 copies. On the independent simulators: a power grid's losses better in 7 of 11 grids and
worse in 4; robot arms' peak torque down 10% to 29% where Omni-Compass moved and left native where the paired trial said
not to; buildings' electricity bought and daily peak better in all 11 battery districts and the bill worse in 7; drone
swarms' energy a mission 7% to 20% lower with no late mission, near miss or collision. The one combined number, the Omni
index over the four real categories confirmed three times, stands at **+30.2%** (`results/OMNI_INDEX.md`): Kubernetes
+25.5%, the database +14.2%, messaging +166.9% and the cache −24.9%, every category weighed the same and every row inside
the noise counted as exactly nothing. The cache's category is negative because the memory it holds is the resource it
trades and reads worse by rule, even as its work and hit rate read better; the index does not hide that.

**What has not been shown, said plainly.** An energy or cloud-bill saving on real machines. Energy on kind is a
declared model, because the machines are containers on one runner. Azure's bill on a 4-worker fleet read no difference
beyond the noise on every gauge, which is the honest reading of a fleet too small to show one machine; the 40-worker
fleet that can show one is preregistered and has been refused by Azure's own cluster capacity in its region, each refusal
recorded. Every earlier GPU result ran on a controller since replaced and is obsolete; the card runs again on rented
hardware at one named commit. Each of these is an open item in section 16, not a footnote.

**How it stays safe.** It watches before it writes. It records every original setting before it acts and reads back
every write. It never writes past a knob's cover. It gives everything back the moment service crosses the wall or a
sense goes blind. It stops writing a knob the instant anyone else touches it. It moves a slow knob only after a paired
trial on the muscle itself shows no more than 2% cost. One OFF switch returns every setting to its original value; a
watchdog with a lease does the same if the governor is killed outright; and a separate kill switch, for security only,
turns the whole harness off in one human hand.

**How you know.** Every run produces receipts: native against omni on the same system, the same load and the same clock,
each gauge with its 95% interval, the raw files archived beside the code and fingerprinted. Results are labelled by a rule
written before the run, confirmed only when three separate runs agree, and reported with every loss in the table.

## Preface

I wrote this book so that whoever connects Omni-Compass to a running system understands what they are
connecting: not only which wire goes where, but why the governor behaves the way it does, where its law comes from,
and how to prove on their own system what it does for them.

The book is in eight parts, and it can be read in two ways.

| You are | Read |
|---|---|
| CEO, board member, investor | the Foreword, the Executive Summary, Part One, the Results to Date, and Part Eight |
| CTO, architect, head of platform | Parts One to Four, then the eight wiring levels in Part Five, then Part Seven |
| The engineer wiring it | everything, in order. Do not skip the wire check or the watch level |
| Auditor, diligence team | Part Two (the mathematics), Part Seven (the proof), Appendices C, F and H |

**Part One, the philosophy and the theory,** sets out the closed circle: a system that is closed, bounded and pulled
toward a center cannot run away, and everything it does is a return. **Part Two, the mathematics,** gives the eight
equations and the control law that make the circle exact, with the theorem, the declaration and the audits that hold
them fixed. **Part Three, the physics,** brings the law into the machine: the compass, push and pull, the band and its
cushions, the physics of a processor, and the two-way nervous system. **Part Four, the body,** lays out the
muscles, the four realms and the six organisms. **Part Five, the harness and the wiring,** is the universal plug and
the step-by-step work of wiring Omni-Compass onto a stack. **Part Six, operating it,** is the OFF switch, the rules
and the log. **Part Seven, proving it,** is every rule written before a run and every result after it. **Part Eight**
is value, the license, the seal and the history.

**Conventions.** `Code` is a command, file or switch exactly as typed. "Native" means a system as it runs today,
without Omni-Compass. "Muscle" means any machine, service or controller Omni-Compass can read and set. "Knob" or
"lever" is one setting on a muscle. "The band" is a knob's or a service reading's safe range. A step that writes to a
system is marked **WRITES**. Every result carries its evidence class: T for a theorem, V for verification of the code,
S for simulation, L for live software, P for a physical meter.

Some chapters gather documents that were written as the work went on, each at the moment its result came in. They
are kept as they were written, because the record of how a result was reached is part of the proof. Where two
chapters give different figures for the same thing, the later run and the State of Play govern.

# Part One. The Philosophy and the Theory

*Where Omni-Compass comes from: the closed circle, the four pieces, the compass and the basins. The engineering in the rest of the book is this idea made exact.*


## 1. What Omni-Compass Is


A governor on a steam engine does not build the engine and does not turn the shaft. It watches the speed and moves the
throttle so the speed stays in a band. Omni-Compass is that, for every machine you run.

It is a process on a host. It reads meters, steps a bounded mathematical law, and writes only the levers it has been
given. It is not the chip, not the GPU driver, not Kubernetes, not the building controller. Those keep running exactly
as they do today; Omni-Compass sets the values they already accept.

### 1.1 Always on top of a native controller

The first design decision, and the one every other follows from, is that Omni-Compass is **supervisory**. It never
replaces the controller a system already has, never bypasses it, and never runs in its place. The Kubernetes
Horizontal Pod Autoscaler keeps scaling pods on its own CPU target; Omni-Compass moves that target inside a range the
operator allows. The cluster autoscaler keeps adding and deleting machines; Omni-Compass marks machines idle and lets the
autoscaler do the deleting. The card's firmware keeps boosting the clock and enforcing its power limit; Omni-Compass sets
the ceiling the boost may reach and the limit the firmware enforces. PgBouncer keeps handing connections to clients;
Omni-Compass sets its pool size through the pooler's own console. Kafka's consumer group keeps rebalancing partitions on
its own; Omni-Compass changes how many consumers are in the group, which is what an operator does. Redis keeps evicting by
its own rule; Omni-Compass sets the ceiling that rule works under.

This matters to a referee for a precise reason: every benchmark in this manual has exactly two arms, **native** (the
system with its own controller, as shipped and as the operator set it) and **omni** (the same system with Omni-Compass on
top). There is no third arm in which Omni-Compass replaces the controller, and no comparison in which Omni-Compass is a
rival to it. A gain is therefore always "what the governor added on top of what the native controller already did", and a
loss is always "what the governor cost on top of it". Nothing in the record is an argument against any native controller;
every native controller in this manual is a good controller that the governor sits on.

### 1.2 Do no harm: the verdict

The second design decision is that Omni-Compass must never make anything worse. This is not a slogan printed on a
report; it is a trigger inside the engine. Before Omni-Compass moves a slow knob (a machine given back, a card's clock
ceiling, a robot axis's speed, a drone's cruise override), it runs a **paired trial on the muscle itself**
(`omnicompass/verdict.py`): the muscle's own cost per piece of work is measured at native and at one step past the
deepest step already allowed, under the same traffic, with at least thirty pieces of work on each side; the step is
allowed only if the trial's median cost is no more than 2% above the reference and no more than 2% above the cost first
measured at native. A refused step is not tried again for a set number of decisions. Where no step passes, the verdict
reads **left native**, the knob is never moved, and the result for that muscle says "nothing for Omni to move". This is
why, in the robot-arm benchmark, two of four arms were left entirely native and are reported as such, and why in the
real Kubernetes tests machines were kept whenever one machine fewer made the requests slower in the trial. Gains are not
capped; the allowance caps only what may be spent to get them.

### 1.3 The pedals, the modes and the two switches

Omni-Compass drives a system the way a self-driving car drives itself: it feels, gauges and adjusts, with nobody in the
seat. The vocabulary is used the same way everywhere in this repository (`docs/MECHANISM_OF_ACTION.md`, "The pedals"):

- **Off (manual).** Omni-Compass is not driving; native runs alone. This is the native arm of every benchmark.
- **Watching.** Omni-Compass reads every gauge and logs the decision it would take, and writes nothing. Any difference
  between a watching arm and native is the cost of its being there (its CPU, its reads) plus noise, never a decision; a
  watching arm that writes anything fails its run. Watching is the first level of every rollout (section 9).
- **Autopilot.** The pedals: **idle** (no foot on the gas or the brake, calm traffic, the engine at its floor of two
  machines in service, ready for the next burst), **gas** (traffic climbs and capacity is added at once, never held back),
  **brake** (traffic falls and capacity is eased off a step at a time, never below idle), **reset** (the brake held to the
  floor: every setting the governor ever wrote is handed back to where native had it, read back, and the record removed;
  every benchmark arm ends with a reset and checks it).
- **Cruise.** For work that comes as a pile: when pods have waited for a place for two decisions in a row, every machine
  goes into service and stays there, without second-guessing, until the line has been empty for two decisions. In cruise
  the governor also stops its five-second floor reads, because every machine is already in service and the reads would
  only cost CPU on the machines the queue is using.
- **The emergency brake.** When the work is done and demand is at zero (the service at its autoscaler's own floor,
  wanting no more, at half its target or less), straight to idle in one move, with every safety check still holding.
- **The kill switch.** Separate from all of the above, and for **security only**: one switch in a human hand
  (`python3 tools/omni_switch.py off`, `omnicompass/master.py`) turns Omni-Compass's governing off across the whole
  machine at once, for anything rogue, or for anyone trying to drive a system through Omni-Compass's brain. Every
  governor hands back and exits; none starts while the switch is off. The reset is the end of a run; the kill switch is
  the end of trust.

The floor of two machines is an operator's number; the brake never takes a system below it, however hard it is pressed.
There is no ceiling: every machine the operator has is usable, and the protection is the band inside each machine.

### 1.4 Nothing is hardwired

Omni-Compass carries no table of per-stack special cases. One law (section 6) is written once and runs on every muscle
through one plug (section 8). The gains differ from muscle to muscle only through the muscle's declared physics: its
response time, its decision period and its cover. Where a rule was found not to work, it was removed, not switched off and
left in the code: the engine files are frozen and fingerprinted, and `verify.py` fails if any of them changes. A reader
who finds a behaviour in a result can find the exact lines that produced it, and will find no second path.

### 1.5 The word

The law is a **compass**: a band with a cushion at each wall, pushed to its middle by two antagonist forces, smooth,
never hammering. The repository uses that word and no other for it. Earlier dated records that used another word are kept
word for word, as records are; the current law is `omnicompass/compass_law.py`, `CompassLaw`.

### 1.6 What it sets, muscle by muscle

Every muscle keeps its own control, and Omni-Compass sets what that control already accepts:

| Muscle | Its own control (kept) | What Omni-Compass sets |
|---|---|---|
| Kubernetes service | the HPA | the HPA's CPU target; replica floors |
| Kubernetes node pool | Cluster Autoscaler / Karpenter / MachineSet | how many machines stay in service (park and wake) |
| NVIDIA GPU | the card's firmware (boost, power and thermal limits) | the clock ceiling (up wire) and the power limit (down wire) |
| CPU | the kernel's frequency governor | the frequency ceiling |
| Data hall, building | the chiller and air handler loops | the supply-air setpoint; units in service |
| Battery site | the inverter | the reserve level; the peak ceiling |
| Robot joint, vehicle axis | the servo loop | speed and effort limits |
| Process loop, feeder | the PI controller | the setpoint inside its band |
| Database behind a pooler | PgBouncer's pool, the DBA's fixed setting | the pool size through the pooler's own console |
| Message broker | the consumer group at the operator's count | how many consumers are in the group |
| Cache | the operator's memory ceiling and eviction rule | the memory ceiling through the cache's own console |
| Substation | the tap changer's own controller | the tap position, one whole tap per move |
| Drone | the shipped autopilot | the cruise override inside the autopilot's limits |

When Omni-Compass stops, every one of those values goes back to what it was before Omni-Compass acted: not to the last
value it wrote, but to the value it read once, before its first write.


## 2. The Unified Circle Principle



![Plate 1. The Unified Circle Principle](plates/unified_circle_principle.jpg)


Omni-Compass begins with one idea: a system that is closed, bounded and pulled toward a center cannot run away, and
everything it does is a return. I call this the closed circle. This chapter states the principle as I hold it, in its
mathematical form, and then says plainly which parts of it the software uses and which parts belong to the wider theory
the software grew out of.

## The statement

    dX/dt = G(X),        X(0) in Omega, a subset of R^n
    G(X) . n(X) <= 0     on the boundary of Omega
    grad L(X) . G(X) <= 0
    =>  lim (t -> infinity) X(t) in M*, a subset of F

Read line by line:

1. **dX/dt = G(X).** The state X moves according to one law G. There is no outside hand: every change comes from the
   law and the state it is in.
2. **X(0) in Omega.** The state starts inside the admissible region Omega: the set of states that are physically and
   operationally allowed.
3. **G(X) . n(X) <= 0 on the boundary.** At the wall of Omega, the flow never points outward (n is the outward normal).
   Nothing that starts inside can cross out. In control theory this is the Nagumo condition: Omega is forward
   invariant.
4. **grad L(X) . G(X) <= 0.** There is a function L, the energy of the compass, that never increases along the motion.
   This is a Lyapunov condition.
5. **=> X(t) settles in M*.** Together, an invariant container and a non-increasing energy force every path into the
   set M* where the energy stops falling: the bottom of the compass.

The power of the statement is that it does not depend on the particular disturbance. Every input up to the size the
container is built for has the same answer before it is asked: the state stays inside and returns. That is what I mean
when I say that a closed circle holds the answer to every question that can be put to it.

## Closure, admissibility, boundedness

![Plate 2. Closed-circle structural architecture of the unified law](plates/closed_circle_architecture.jpg)


The theory sets five requirements on any law that claims to close the circle:

| Requirement | Meaning | In the engine |
|---|---|---|
| Finite deviation | the distance from the admissible state has a ceiling, abs(E) <= E_max | the deviation state E drains faster than it can fill |
| Finite curvature | the landscape the state moves on has no infinite slopes or pits | the drive is bounded by tanh; the authority is clipped |
| Global conservation | what flows in is matched by what flows out | the drain and the bath's friction match the drive |
| Recurrence | a disturbed state returns arbitrarily close to where it was | convergence to the target pole at rate K_P |
| One law | every subsystem obeys the same law, no special cases | one engine, one compass, every muscle |

## The closed circle tested

![Plate 3. The closed circle tested](plates/closed_circle_tested.jpg)


The canonical evolution law has four parts: deviation is damped nonlinearly and coupled to alignment and to the basin;
alignment relaxes toward unity and responds to deviation; the basin's curvature evolves with internal structure; damping
absorbs excess growth and redistributes energy. Bounded random noise is permitted; divergence is not. A cycle is
identified when the system returns arbitrarily close to a prior state within a bounded tolerance under noise. The state
advances stepwise under a stable numerical integrator with boundedness checks. Under parameter sweeps the test is
always the same three checks: no divergence, bounded, recurring.

## Symmetry and conservation in the closed circle

![Plate 4. Symmetry principles and conservation laws in the closed circle](plates/symmetry_conservation.jpg)


Every conservation law is the shadow of a symmetry (Noether). The closed circle carries four:

| Symmetry | Conserved | In Omni-Compass |
|---|---|---|
| Temporal (the law does not change with time) | energy | the same law governs every decision; the receipt compares like with like |
| Spatial (the law does not depend on where) | momentum | the same law governs every muscle in every realm |
| Rotational | angular momentum | the compass is symmetric about its center; the engine is symmetric between its poles |
| Internal alignment | alignment invariance | the alignment state is pulled to its pole whichever pole it is |

Around them sit the boundary conditions of the circle: maximum deviation (the boundary limit), topological closure
(bounded wholeness), nonlinear dynamics (complex interactions), resonant reversal (feedback return), energy-momentum
conservation, and cross-scale invariance (scale-independent patterns).

## Scale invariance

![Plate 5. Scale invariance and structural universality](plates/scale_invariance.jpg)


The theory claims that one bounded nonlinear action has the same form at every scale: cosmological (curvature
geometry, compression and expansion, thermodynamic cycling), galactic (rotation curves, mass-energy distribution),
stellar (gravitational compression, fusion equilibrium, radiative transport), atomic (electron displacement, orbital
coherence, radiative damping) and quantum (localized deviation wells, bounded oscillation, finite amplitude). The
universal criteria for such a law are that it operates at every scale and preserves bounded deviation, finite curvature
and recurrence. The state vector carries the same meaning at every scale: E the deviation magnitude, U the coherence or
flow alignment, S the structural curvature or basin geometry, B the redistribution or damping.

## The lineage of unification

![Plate 6. The lineage of unification](plates/lineage_of_unification.jpg)


Each step in the history of physics unified two things that had been separate: geometry formalized structure; motion
was unified across earth and sky; astronomy revealed recurrence; fields replaced action at a distance; curvature unified
gravity, though singularities remained; symmetry came to govern the quantum realm. The closed circle is offered as the
next step: unity without divergence, a single bounded law with no singularity and no runaway.

## What is tested and what is theory

![Plate 7. A candidate for a closed, unified law](plates/candidate_closed_law.jpg)


The software uses the engineering core of this principle, and every part of that core is checked:

- The six-state engine, its bounded control command held through the integration step, and the convergence of its
  alignment state to its pole are proved (`docs/TRACKING_THEOREM.md`) and tested against a C++ twin.
- The invariance and boundedness of each engine state were checked state by state (Chapter "Closing the Circle").
- The compass law pulls every muscle's service reading to the middle of its band under a bounded, smooth force, and its
  behavior is measured in simulation and on real software.

The wider claims - one law across every physical scale, the cosmological and quantum readings, the candidate unified
action - are the theory from which Omni-Compass was built. They are stated here so that the engineer understands where
the design comes from. They are not claims that the software has measured, and no result in this book depends on them.


## 3. The Four-Piece Engine


![Plate 8. The Omni-Compass Grand Theory: the four pieces](plates/grand_theory.jpg)


The engine is built in four pieces, stacked like the stages of a press, each feeding the next:

| Piece | Name | What it establishes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Foundational Engine | the base laws, the states and the boundaries: a closed, bounded, nonlinear adaptive engine with a four-state dynamical structure (misalignment, alignment recovery, coherence potential, path interaction), bounded convergence and persistence with decay, intrinsic feedback and stabilization, and an empirical validation framework for recovery |
| 2 | Geometric Response | geometric alignment and response dynamics: a geometric coherence field, a unified potential governing geometric deformation, and the propagation mechanism of that response |
| 3 | Coherence Evolution | coherence through response and adaptation: the coherence-response envelope, the system response field, and the coupling of coherence state with response propagation |
| 4 | Unified Master Field Law | one coherent field structure: it integrates pieces 1-3 into one closed dynamical structure with a unified potential governing all subsystems, bidirectional propagation between engine state, geometry and response, bounded convergence across the whole system, and no external authority: all evolution emerges from internal coupling |

The four pieces compress every domain through one center core. The compression process has four stages: the domains
unordered; compression in progress; coherence achieved; return to equilibrium. The result has four properties:
coherent, bounded, admissible, stable - one law, one return, one cycle.

**The 24 domains.** The theory gathers 24 domains into four quadrants around that core:

| Quadrant | Domains |
|---|---|
| 1. Foundational structures | Newtonian gravity; Maxwell electromagnetism; Einstein relativity; Schrodinger quantum mechanics; Shannon information theory; Dirac quantum field theory |
| 2. Dynamics and symmetries | Noether symmetry laws; Hamiltonian dynamics; Lagrangian mechanics; thermodynamics; topology; differential geometry |
| 3. Coherence evolution | gauge field theory; fluid dynamics; field theory; discrete mathematics; solid-state physics; plasma physics |
| 4. Complex systems and integration | astrophysics; consciousness and information integration; biological systems and self-organization; universal mathematical structure; systems theory and complex adaptive systems; the unified Omni-Compass domain (the unified admissible state) |

![Plate 9. The unified container of all reality: 24 domains, four-piece engine, one closure law](plates/four_piece_engine.jpg)

![Plate 10. The four quadrants and the compression process](plates/unified_container.jpg)

![Plate 11. The closure law and the closed-circle engine](plates/closure_law.jpg)

**In the software,** the four pieces appear as the engine's state equations (piece 1: deviation, alignment, memory and
basin), the basin potential and its flow (piece 2), the bath that absorbs and redistributes (piece 3), and the one
governor that couples every muscle to one law with no outside authority (piece 4).


## 4. The Compass


![Plate 12. The Omni-Compass rose](plates/compass_rose.jpg)

![Plate 13. The Omni-Compass Principle](plates/omni_compass_principle.jpg)


The Omni-Compass rose is the whole mechanism drawn as one picture.

**The ring.** Twenty-four letters, the complete Greek alphabet from Alpha to Omega: the complete set, nothing missing,
one letter for each domain. On a ring the end runs back into the beginning: after the last letter the ring returns to
Alpha. That is the closed circle: identity, return, cycle.

**The four points.** Four letters are lifted out of alphabetical order and set on the four points of the rose:

| Point | Letter | Mark | Meaning in the engine |
|---|---|---|---|
| North | Alpha, the first | + | the positive pole of the alignment's double well, U = +1 |
| South | Omega, the last | - | the negative pole, U = -1 |
| East | Beta | > | the drive coming in (the beta terms that fill the deviation) |
| West | Gamma | < | the coupling that carries energy out to the bath, where friction absorbs it |

The north-south line is polarity; the east-west line is flow in against flow out. A system stays inside its circle
exactly when what flows out can always match what flows in.

**The inner marks.**

| Mark | Meaning | In the mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| + and - | the two polarities | the two poles of the double well |
| > and < | push out, pull in | the antagonist pair: the up force and the down force |
| the double arrow | exchange both ways | the two-way wire: read in, write out |
| the up-tack | the ceiling | the cover: nothing goes past the top |
| approximately-equal | the wave, the tolerance | the band and its cushion: hold near the center |
| the star | the guiding star | the target the needle points to |

**The center.** The spiral at the middle is the attractor: every path winds inward to one point.

**Opposite letters.** Across the center, zeta faces xi: both are the engineer's symbol for the damping ratio, and a
damping ratio of one is the critical glide to the center with no overshoot. Lambda faces psi: the eigenvalue and the
wave function of the eigenvalue equation.


## 5. Basins, Polarity and the Dual-Basin Engine


## Geometric funneling and basin formation

![Plate 14. Geometric funneling and basin formation](plates/geometric_funneling.jpg)


A basin forms in three stages. While the driving tension T is low, curvature is weak and there is no dominant basin:
flows spread outward. As T increases, curvature concentrates and a positive feedback loop begins. Then a stable
geometric funnel forms: self-reinforcing curvature, finite depth, bounded deviation, with the boundary abs(E) <= E_max
respected. Structure emerges from fluctuation through curvature concentration and feedback.

In the engine, the basin state S rolls down its potential Phi(S) to a stable bottom; in the compass, every muscle's service
reading is pulled into the bottom of its own funnel.

## Polarity

Two like charges repel without anyone pushing them: the force comes from the shape of the field. A wall built of like
polarity at the edge of a band pushes the state back harder the closer it comes (as one over the distance squared),
and two such walls cancel at the center, where the state comes to rest. This is the boundary condition of the closed
circle written as a force: the field itself points inward at the wall.

The repulsion does not create energy: the field stores what it took to bring the charges together. What is gained in
the computer is that the force is computed rather than spent: the brain computes it at no physical cost, and the
machine's energy is saved because its knob no longer fights itself.

A symmetric pair of repelling walls was tested on the modelled GPU card. It raised work per energy but also raised the
time spent past the service line, because the lower wall pushed capacity away when the card was calm. It was removed.
The upper wall alone remains a candidate.

## The dual-basin engine

![Plate 15. The Omni-Compass dual-basin engine](plates/black_hole_engine.jpg)


The dual-basin engine is a recursive transform with five stages:

1. **Compression.** Two outer basins of positive polarity draw matter and energy inward in a spiral; rotation organizes
   the flow; compression increases toward the center.
2. **Saturation.** At the center, two cores of negative polarity meet back to back; the basin structure S reaches its
   critical value and the curvature reaches its maximum.
3. **Transition (ignition).** Where the cores touch, the transition operator T(X) = sigma(S - S_c) T(X) activates:
   compression halts and redistribution begins.
4. **Redistribution.** Two axial jets carry the excess out along the axis, with opposite helicity to the inflow.
5. **Reset and recurrence.** The domain relaxes and the cycle repeats.

The core mathematics is a bounded flow: dX/dt = G(X, t) with abs(G(X)) <= C_G, a curvature envelope K(X) <= K_max, and
a redistribution term that activates only at saturation. The state X = (E, U, S, B) stays in its admissible domain,
whose horizon boundary is forward invariant (the Nagumo condition again).

**For an engineer,** the transform reads: pull toward the center (compression); a wall where the muscle saturates;
and, when one muscle saturates, move the excess to its siblings rather than hammering it (redistribution). The first two
are built into the compass. Redistribution across muscles is designed and not yet built; it is on the roadmap.


# Part Two. The Mathematics

*Eight equations, one control law, and the proofs, audits and declarations that hold them fixed.*


## 6. The Canonical Declaration



Every report the engine has ever produced opens with the same declaration. It is the birth certificate of the
mechanism: what the engine is, which equations it runs, what every symbol means, which parameters it samples, how a
run is born, conveyed and certified, and what the engine is allowed to say about itself. This chapter sets it down in
full so that anyone who reads the rest of this book can always come back to the source.

## The identity of the engine

The Omni-Compass Unified Governing Convergence Control Core Engine. One canonical eight-line mathematical core,
called Piece I, integrated by fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) and exercised by Monte Carlo. Around that core sit the
benchmark suites: the public enterprise manager mechanism benchmark, the one-stack-normalized global megastack,
fragmented stack governance over matched scenarios, and the enterprise evidence suite covering cause, fail-safe,
scale, muscle, security and economics. All of them run on bare metal, on premises, private, public, hybrid and edge
alike, because the core does not care where it runs.

## The equation form (authoritative, eight lines)

    (1) dE/dt   = -α_E E + β_int(t) + β_ext(t) + v_eff
    (2) dU/dt   = μ U(1 - U²) - (dE/dt)/E_max - λ_U U + u,      |u| ≤ U_AUTHORITY
    (3) dI_U/dt = 1 - U - σ₁ E - δ S - λ_I I_U
    (4) v_eff   = χ(t) c · tanh(λ₀ + λ₁(U - U_t) + λ₂ S),       χ(t) = cos(ω_B t / 2)
    (5) Φ(S)    = ½ α_s S² + ¼ β_s S³ - δ S
    (6) dS/dt   = F_state(S) = -∂Φ(S)/∂S = δ - α_s S - ¾ β_s S²
    (7) B'' + (ω_B / Q_B) B' + ω_B² B = γ_c δ S                   [continuous]
    (8) R_B[n] = D²_h B[n] + (ω_B / Q_B) D⁻_h B[n] + ω_B² B[n] - γ_c δ S[n] = 0    [discrete audit]

Line (1) is the error, the energy of misalignment: it decays at its own rate, it is pushed by forces from inside and
outside, and it is pushed by the effective velocity of the system. Line (2) is coherence, the alignment index: it
lives in a double well with two homes at +1 and -1, it is pulled down by any rise in error, it leaks, and it is the
one line the governor touches, through the control u, which is never allowed beyond its authority. Line (3) is the
information channel that keeps the record of how far coherence has been from home. Line (4) is the effective
velocity, saturated so that it can never exceed the limiting speed c, and multiplied by the spinor phase. Lines (5)
and (6) are the potential of the coherence state and the flow it creates, downhill. Line (7) is the bath, the field
that every real system sits in, driven by the state. Line (8) is the bath written on the grid the computer actually
steps on: it is an audit of the numbers, not a second bath.

## The control law

    σ        = nearest_signed_basin(U₀)
    u_m      = sat(-f_U(x_m, t_m) + K_P (σ - U_m), ± U_AUTHORITY)
    x_(m+1)  = RK4_h(x_m; u_m),   u_m held across all four RK4 stages

The nearest signed basin is declared at Step 0, before the first microstep. The control cancels the natural drift
of coherence and adds a proportional pull to the declared home, then it is clipped at its authority. It is held
fixed through the four stages of each RK4 step. There is no post-step overwrite of the state and no projection onto
the basin. Whatever the engine reaches, it reaches by the flow of its own equations.

## The symbol chart

![Plate 18. The equation form and the symbol chart](plates/equation_chart.jpg)

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| E | Error, the misalignment energy |
| U | Coherence, the alignment index |
| I_U | Information, the internal-coherence channel |
| S | Coherence state potential |
| B | Bath field |
| B' | Bath field time derivative |
| α | Feedback rate |
| β_int(t) | Internal forcing function |
| β_ext(t) | External forcing function |
| k | Coherence logistic damping gain |
| σ₁ | Coupling of error into the information channel |
| δ | Linear coherence coupling parameter |
| λ₀ | Saturation bias |
| λ₁ | Saturation gain |
| λ₂ | S-state coupling gain |
| U_t | Target coherence state |
| c | Limiting velocity |
| E_max | Per-trajectory error-rate normalization scale |
| α_s | S-potential quadratic coefficient |
| β_s | S-potential cubic coefficient |
| Φ(S) | Potential field function |
| F_state(S) | Canonical S-state flow |
| ω_B | Bath frequency |
| Q_B | Bath quality factor |
| γ_c | Bath coupling gain |

## The coupling architecture of Piece I

The closed feedback core is E, U and S: error drives coherence, coherence and the state drive the velocity, the
velocity drives error. The information channel I_U and the bath B with its derivative are driven response channels:
they listen to the core and record it, and the core does not depend on them. γ₁ is reserved for compatibility and is
inactive in the Piece I derivatives. The bath law uses ω_B² B, so ω_B carries the units of angular frequency.
Line (7) advances B and B' continuously by RK4. Line (8) evaluates the discrete residual with
D²_h B[n] = (B[n+1] - 2B[n] + B[n-1]) / h² and D⁻_h B[n] = (B[n] - B[n-1]) / h.

## The spinor closure

The spinor extension introduces the phase θ(t) = ω_B t and multiplies line (4) by χ(θ) = cos(θ/2). At 0 degrees the
factor is +1, at 360 degrees it is -1, and at 720 degrees it is +1 again. A full turn of the bath reverses the sign
of the velocity; only two full turns bring it home. The standard 20-step run evaluates the part of the phase it
reaches, and a dedicated evidence test checks the 0, 360 and 720 degree periodicity on its own.

## The signed basins

The canonical Monte Carlo sampler draws the starting coherence U(0) symmetrically on [-1, +1]. The nearest signed
basin at Step 0 is declared the target before the first microstep. That keeps the eight-line equation exactly as
written while making every governed run exercise capture into both +1 and -1. A separate dual-basin suite throws
runs across from one basin to the other under disturbance and watches them recover.

## Birth, conveyance and certification

Step 0 is the sampled state before integration. Step 1 is the first completed macro step. A run has at most 20
macro steps of 10 micro steps each, at a time step of 0.1. A step is in basin when U lies within 0.10 of +1 or -1.

- **Born in basin.** A run that starts inside a basin at Step 0 is born in basin for life. Step 0 counts as the
  first observation of its streak. It is confirmed conveyed after Steps 0 to 4 stay in the same basin. It is never
  called self-tuned, and it stays under the same regulation for all 20 macro steps.
- **Self-tuning.** A run that starts outside both basins is self-tuning applied from Step 1. The same nearest-basin
  law is active on every trajectory, born or not, over the whole 200-microstep horizon. The category never switches
  the regulation off.
- **CONVEY-5.** Five consecutive same-basin observations. The first is the conveyance entry step, the fifth is the
  confirmation step. The latest streak may start at Step 16 and confirm on Step 20.
- **CERT-10.** Ten consecutive same-basin observations. The latest streak may start at Step 11 and complete on
  Step 20. The code asserts both bounds before it runs and checks every emitted row against them.

Conveyance is an event, not an ending. No run may be both born in basin and self-tuned. Stability is judged on the
history, not on one snapshot.

## The Monte Carlo declaration

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Initial U distribution | Uniform on [-1, +1], symmetric |
| Monte Carlo runs | 500 |
| Macro steps per run | 20 |
| Micro steps per macro step | 10 |
| Integration time step | 0.1 |
| Basin centers | +1 and -1 |
| Basin tolerance | 0.10 |
| Stability window | 5 |
| Conveyance cutoff step | 20 |

The full horizon is always executed. A run is classified as a failure if it crosses the divergence threshold at any
recorded state, or if it exhausts the horizon without CONVEY-5.

## The parameter sets

| Group | Parameter | Value or range |
|---|---|---|
| Core | α | 4.2 |
| Core | β_int | 0.0 to 1.0 |
| Core | β_ext | 0.0 to 1.0 |
| Core | E_max | 1.0 to 10.0, sampled once per trajectory |
| Core | k | 1.7 |
| Information and coupling | σ₁ | 0.38 |
| Information and coupling | δ | 0.01 to 1.0 |
| Information and coupling | γ₁ | 1.35, reserved, inactive in the derivatives |
| Information and coupling | γ_c | 1.0 |
| Saturation and phase | c | 0.5 to 5.0 |
| Saturation and phase | λ₀ | -2.0 to 2.0 |
| Saturation and phase | λ₁ | 0.1 to 3.0 |
| Saturation and phase | λ₂ | 0.0 to 2.0 |
| Saturation and phase | U_t | 0.5 |
| Saturation and phase | χ(t) | cos(ω_B t / 2) when the spinor closure is on |
| S-state potential | α_s | 0.05 to 0.25 |
| S-state potential | β_s | 0.05 to 0.25 |
| Bath | ω_B | 0.1 to 5.0 |
| Bath | Q_B | 0.5 to 10.0 |
| Noise and drift | D | 0.0 |
| Noise and drift | μ | 0.0 |

## The mechanism-bound reporting doctrine

Every table, grid, chart, scorecard, classification and conclusion the engine emits must be computed from what it
actually executed: the trajectory rows, the recorded state histories of E, U, I_U, S, B and B', the sampled
parameters, the RK4 derivative evaluations, the basin entry and dwell histories, the line (8) residuals, the solver
comparisons, the ablations, the disturbance and stress runs, the compute benchmark event records, and the enterprise
benchmark ledgers.

No decorative grade, inferred score, hand-assigned quality category or presentation-only number is allowed to stand
as an engine result. Prose may point to the exact source and the edge of the claim. It may not manufacture evidence,
put a grade where a measurement belongs, or present a grid the mechanism never ran as though it had. That doctrine
runs through every page of this book.

## Availability and the rights boundary

Time is of the essence. Omni-Compass is available from The Omni-Compass LLC for controlled technical evaluation,
research collaboration, pilot integration, strategic engagement and separately licensed commercial deployment. The
same rights boundary applies at every level of use: inspection, local execution, simulation, research,
benchmarking, observe-only, shadow mode, supervised control, bounded autopilot, hybrid control, direct-to-muscle
control, production, embedding, hosted service, productization, monetization, redistribution and derivative work.

Public access does not make Omni-Compass open source. Commercial use of any kind requires a separately executed
written license. The instrument is a license, not a sale and not a transfer of ownership. For planning only, the
introductory benchmark is 10% of independently verified and contractually accepted value captured; the base and the
amount are specific to each company, the terms are expected to rise as validation and adoption grow, and only a
signed agreement creates any obligation.

## 7. The Engine: Eight Equations and One Control Law


The engine (`omnicompass/core.py`, frozen and fingerprinted) carries a six-part state x = (E, U, I_U, S, B, B_dot):

| State | Meaning | Physical picture |
|---|---|---|
| E | deviation: how far the system is from where it should be | a tank that fills with stress and drains on its own |
| U | alignment, between the two poles -1 and +1 | a ball in a double well: two stable poles, a hill between them |
| I_U | memory of misalignment | an integrator that remembers and slowly forgets |
| S | basin structure | a ball rolling to the bottom of its landscape |
| B, B_dot | the bath | a spring with friction that absorbs and settles energy |

The eight equations (Appendix C gives them in full):

1. dE/dt = -alpha_E E + beta_int + beta_ext + v_eff
2. dU/dt = mu U (1 - U^2) - (dE/dt)/E_max - lambda_U U + u, with |u| <= 25
3. dI_U/dt = (1 - U) - sigma_1 E - delta S - lambda_I I_U
4. v_eff = cos(omega_B t / 2) c tanh(lambda_0 + lambda_1 (U - 0.5) + lambda_2 S)
5. Phi(S) = alpha_s S^2/2 + beta_s S^3/4 - delta S
6. dS/dt = -dPhi/dS
7. d2B/dt2 = gamma_c delta S - (omega_B/Q_B) dB/dt - omega_B^2 B
8. R_B: a finite-difference audit of (7), never fed back

**The control law.** u = clip(-f_U(x, t) + K_P (sigma - U), -25, +25), where f_U is the drift of U with the command
at zero, sigma is the target pole and K_P = 12. The first term cancels whatever is shoving U (the push); the second
pulls U to its pole, harder the farther it is (the pull). The command is held unchanged through every stage of the
fourth-order Runge-Kutta step and U is never rewritten afterwards. Inside the authority limit, U converges to its pole
at rate K_P; this is proved (`docs/TRACKING_THEOREM.md`).

### 4.1 What each equation does, in words

The six numbers describe the whole system the way a physician's six vital signs describe a patient, and each equation
says how one of them moves.

- **Equation 1, the deviation tank.** *E* is how hard the system is being driven: queues, overload, power, heat. It
  drains on its own at a fixed rate (alpha_E = 3.487) and is filled by two pressures, internal (queue and overload,
  beta_int) and external (power, heat, network, staleness, security, beta_ext), plus a drive term v_eff that is bounded
  by a hyperbolic tangent. However extreme the observation, the engine's response rate is capped at c = 1. This is the
  saturation, the "speed limit" that no input can exceed.
- **Equation 2, the alignment.** *U* is how healthy and settled the system is, and it lives in a double well: two stable
  poles at +1 (healthy) and −1 (failed) with an unstable ridge at 0. A rising deviation pushes *U* out of the healthy
  well; the bounded command *u* pulls it back. The cubic term mu U (1 − U²) is what makes the walls of the well push back
  harder the farther *U* strays.
- **Equation 3, the memory.** *I_U* grows while *U* is below its pole, is reduced by deviation and stress already being
  dealt with, and leaks at lambda_I = 0.719. It is the engine's memory of unrelieved pressure: a system that has been
  stressed for an hour is not the same as one stressed for a second, and this integrator is what knows the difference.
- **Equation 4, the drive.** The bounded drive v_eff mixes the alignment and the stress through a tanh, with a slow
  cosine of the bath's frequency on top, so the drive breathes rather than pushes constantly.
- **Equations 5 and 6, the stress.** *S* rolls downhill in a cubic potential to its stable root. It is the slowest
  restoring force: structural stress from heat, power, network, security and staleness that builds and relaxes over
  minutes rather than seconds.
- **Equation 7, the bath.** A damped harmonic oscillator (natural frequency omega_B = 1, quality Q_B = 2.5) driven by
  stress. It turns stress into a smooth, lagged tide, and it is the only second-order element in the engine; its friction
  is what settles the whole.
- **Equation 8, the audit.** The bath equation is re-checked numerically every step with a finite difference, and the
  check is recorded and never fed back: an instrument on the engine, not a part of it.

Integration is classical fourth-order Runge-Kutta, ten micro-steps of 0.01 per macro step, and the C++ twin matches the
Python to 3.6 × 10⁻¹⁵ on 500 reference trajectories (section 18).

### 4.2 From telemetry to state, and from state to action

Each decision, the telemetry is normalised to nine observations: queue, load, power, thermal, network, drift, staleness,
security and conflict. An observed state is computed from them by fixed weights (`omnicompass/adapter.py`,
`observe_vector`), the engine's state is blended toward it with weight 0.339, and the state is then evolved by one macro
step of the equations. From the state, the governor evaluates the control's push, u(x)/25, which is a number between −1
and +1 that says how hard the engine is pulling toward health; a target utilisation that falls as the memory and the
deviation rise; whether a release (giving something back) is permitted at all, which is only while the push reports
convergence and the band and dwell allow; and whether change is permitted, which requires *U* above its gate and no
security block. All of this is written to the audit every decision (`docs/MECHANISM_OF_ACTION.md`, sections 3 to 6, and
`python tools/mechanism.py`, which reproduces the measured numbers in `results/MECHANISM_OF_ACTION.json`).

### 4.3 Where the engine sits, and where the compass law sits

A reader meeting the engine and then the compass law (section 6) may ask which of the two moves the knob. The answer, in
the live controllers, is this: the **compass law** sets each knob, the **verdict** narrows where the law may go, and the
**engine** grants the authority, feeds the release gate and the nervous system, and is audited every decision
(`omni_controller/controller.py`, its docstring). The engine is the organism's physiology: how stressed it is, how long
it has been, whether it is settling. The compass law is the hand on each lever. The engine's own control law *u* is
evaluated, not applied to a knob directly: it is the push the nervous system reads to decide whether giving anything
back is permitted now. This separation is why the engine could be frozen with its proofs untouched while the compass law
was written as its own, separately tested law, and why `verify.py` seals both.


## 8. The Canonical Engine



One engine runs Omni-Compass, and every result in this repository comes from it. This page names it, gives its
equations exactly as the code computes them, and names every other form as a variant. Where any document, manual, chart
or filing states the equations differently, this page and the file it fingerprints are what the software runs.

### 1. The canonical engine: `symmetric_verified`

| | |
|---|---|
| Name | `symmetric_verified` (`omnicompass/configurations.py`, `DEFAULT`) |
| Code | `omnicompass/core.py` (Python), `cpp/src/core.cpp` (C++ twin, sealed in `results/SEAL.json`) |
| Fingerprint | SHA-256 of `omnicompass/core.py`, recorded in `results/PREREGISTRATION.json` and `RELEASE_MANIFEST.json`; checked by `verify.py` |
| Evidence | every simulation, benchmark, live Kubernetes run and GPU harness in this repository |

State: E (deviation), U (coherence), I_U (unmet-need integral), S (structural stress), B and B_dot (the bath).

```
v_eff  = cos(omega_B t / 2) · c · tanh(lambda_0 + lambda_1 (U − 0.5) + lambda_2 S)        (spinor closure, 720°)
dE/dt  = −alpha_E E + beta_int + beta_ext + v_eff
dU/dt  = mu U (1 − U²) − (dE/dt) / E_max − lambda_U U + u                                 (symmetric double well)
dI_U/dt = (1 − U) − sigma_1 E − delta S − lambda_I I_U
dS/dt  = delta − alpha_s S − (3/4) beta_s S²                                               (gradient of Phi)
dB/dt  = B_dot
dB_dot/dt = gamma_c delta S − (omega_B / Q_B) B_dot − omega_B² B
Phi(S) = alpha_s S² / 2 + beta_s S³ / 4 − delta S
```
u is the controller's command, `KP (target − U) − drift`, bounded by `U_AUTHORITY`; integration is RK4 with the
macro and micro steps of `omnicompass/core.py`.

#### Mechanism identity

`results/MECHANISM_IDENTITY.json` (`tools/mechanism_identity.py`) fingerprints the mechanism
M = (F, Theta, C, h, G, M_act, dt, A) component by component: state law, parameters, controller, observation map,
authority law, actuator map, execution timing, shield. `verify.py` fails if any component changes without the record
being rewritten. Every evidence claim names the mechanism id that produced it; "the eight-line engine" alone names none.

| Configuration | Mechanism id | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `symmetric_verified` | `29d9808dfb8f626ad5de17a8a1efa37411dbab08a64af4b276143b466f7ce21c` | canonical |
| `printed_eight_line` | `cd333dc166fb7684ec0fca71f5f50488041e47825ee47d1ea667bec1f3d2259d` | named alternative embodiment |

On the frozen 500-fixture population (`benchmarks/core_evidence.py`, seed 223387268), both are executable and neither
is a stand-in for the other:

| | finite | CONVEY-5 | CERT-10 | mean final target error | mean integrated abs(u) | max abs(u) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `symmetric_verified` | 500/500 | 500/500 | 500/500 | 7.48e-5 | 0.878 | 13.93 |
| `printed_eight_line` | 500/500 | 500/500 | 500/500 | 5.13e-6 | 11.79 | 18.87 |

The printed form reaches its target more tightly with about 13 times the control effort. The structure is Option A:
one canonical configuration, one named alternative; no equivalence is claimed.

### 2. Variants

#### `printed_eight_line` (the printed chart)
Implemented in `omnicompass/configurations.py`, checked against the printed plate (`tests/test_engine_configurations.py`),
**not benchmarked**: no result in this repository comes from it.

```
v_eff  = c · tanh(lambda_0 + lambda_1 (U − U_t) + lambda_2 S)                             (no spinor factor)
dE/dt  = −alpha E + beta_int + beta_ext + v_eff
dU/dt  = alpha (1 − U) − (dE/dt) / E_max − k U (1 − U) + u                                 (logistic)
dI_U/dt = (1 − U) − sigma_1 E − delta S                                                    (no lambda_I term)
dS/dt, dB/dt, dB_dot/dt as in section 1
```

Differences from the canonical engine: logistic U instead of the symmetric double well; no spinor factor; a general
target U_t; no lambda_I damping; alpha in place of alpha_E. alpha_U and k enter the printed form; they do not enter the
canonical engine.

### 3. What would change this declaration

Promoting a variant to canonical needs, in one commit: the variant run through every harness beside the canonical
engine, its results reported next to the canonical results, this page and `RELEASE_MANIFEST.json` updated, and the
preregistration amended on record (`results/LOCK_AMENDMENTS.json`). Until then the canonical engine is
`symmetric_verified`.

### 4. Open mathematical items (from `docs/FORMAL_STATUS.md` and the handoff)

- A global stability proof of the forced six-state system is not closed. What is held on the U channel is proved in
  `docs/TRACKING_THEOREM.md`: unsaturated exponential tracking; the saturated case under a drift bound that holds over
  the declared box (F_bar = 16.86 < 25); the sampled-data bound of the executed RK4 controller; admissibility.
- Candidate routes: the Unified Circle Principle on a region; Theorem 5.6 of the Closed Structure, if its core maps onto
  (E, U, I_U, S, B).

### 5. For filings

Which form a patent or copyright filing claims as the principal embodiment is a decision for The Omni-Compass LLC and
its counsel. Whatever that decision, the software described by this repository runs the canonical engine of section 1,
and a filing that claims the printed form should name `symmetric_verified` as the embodiment that has been implemented
and tested, or the printed form should be benchmarked first (section 3).

## 9. The Closed Circle: Why It Cannot Leave Its Compass


The governing principle is the Unified Circle Principle:

    dX/dt = G(X),  X(0) in Omega
    G(X) . n(X) <= 0 on the boundary of Omega        (the flow points inward at the wall: nothing crosses)
    grad L(X) . G(X) <= 0                            (the compass's energy L only falls)
    => lim X(t) in M*                                (every path settles in the bottom of the compass)

In control engineering the second line is the Nagumo condition for an invariant set and the third is a Lyapunov
function. Together they mean: anything that starts inside the container stays inside it, for every disturbance up to a
known size, and comes to rest at the bottom. That is a certificate, not a test: it answers every case inside the walls
at once.

**In plain words.** Picture a bowl-shaped valley with a fence around its rim. The first line says the valley has a
shape: given where the system is, the equations say which way it rolls. The second line says that at the fence the
ground always slopes inward, so nothing that starts inside can ever roll out, however it is pushed within the strength
the fence was built for. The third line says there is a height, *L*, that only ever decreases along any path, so the
system cannot circle forever at one level; it must keep descending. The conclusion follows: every path ends at the
bottom, the set *M\**. The engineering value of such a certificate is that it is not a sample of behaviours; it is a
statement about all of them at once, inside the fence.

**What is certified, and what is not.** The certificate is about the engine's own state: the six numbers of section 4
stay inside their walls and settle. It is not a certificate about the plant the engine governs, whose physics the engine
does not contain; that is why every plant is tested paired against native (Part VI), why the compass law clips every
write to the knob's cover (section 6), and why the shield between the engine and the levers is tested separately on two
million adversarial cases with zero violations (`tests/test_shield_properties.py`) and the C++ engine soaked on one
hundred million decisions with no failure (`results/SOAK.json`). The mathematics closes the brain; the harness, the cover,
the verdict and the paired receipts close the hand.

The engine's states are each closed in this sense: the deviation tank drains faster than it can fill; the alignment's
cubic walls push back from far out; the memory forgets; the bath's friction settles it. The rule behind all four is
the compass's east-west line: what flows out (drain, damping) must always be able to match what flows in (drive). The
formal status of each statement, what is proved, what is tested and what is conjecture, is written out in
`docs/FORMAL_STATUS.md` and `docs/TRACKING_THEOREM.md`, and the theory chapters of this book (The Unified Circle
Principle, Closing the Circle in the Engine) give the derivations.

**The compass.** The Omni-Compass rose carries the whole Greek alphabet, Alpha to Omega: the complete set, in a ring
whose end runs back into its beginning. Its north-south axis is polarity: Alpha and plus at the top, Omega and minus at
the bottom, the two poles of the alignment's double well. Its east-west axis is flow: Beta and the push outward on one
side, Gamma and the pull inward on the other, the drive and the damping. The spiral at the center is the attractor
every path winds into. The ring closing on itself is the return: when Omni-Compass stops, every lever returns to where
it began.


## 10. Closing the Circle in the Engine


![Plate 16. Mathematical integration](plates/mathematical_integration.jpg)

![Plate 17. The engine core: the governing law in motion](plates/engine_core.jpg)


Each state of the engine was checked against the closed-circle conditions:

| State | Closed? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| E, deviation | closed | it drains at rate alpha_E while its inputs are bounded (the drive is capped by tanh) |
| U, alignment | closed | the cubic term mu U (1 - U^2) pushes back hard from far out |
| I_U, memory | closed | it forgets at rate lambda_I |
| B, the bath | closed | the friction omega_B / Q_B settles it |
| S, the basin | closed on the positive side; open on the negative side below an unstable ridge | Phi(S) carries a cubic term, so the landscape falls away below the ridge (at S = -3.5 with the default parameters) |

Three openings were found and each has its closure:

1. **The basin's negative side.** A quartic term in Phi(S) would give the compass a wall on both sides. This changes the
   frozen engine and is a new version with its own proof.
2. **The outer loop.** The frozen live governor computes the push and pull u and uses it as a convergence signal; it
   does not send u to a lever. The compass closes this loop: reading, force, plug, lever, read-back. On the modelled card
   this is the difference between +0.1% and several percent of work per energy (the one-wire governor against the
   corrected two-wire compass, `results/sim/gpu_two_wire/`).
3. **The corner.** clip() is a hard stop; tanh is its smooth form. The compass uses tanh.

**What closing the loop has shown since.** The compass law of the second opening is the law every result in the manual
was made on: it was frozen as Omni v1 on 5 October 2026 with its proofs untouched, grown to the 945-muscle catalog as v2,
and given one gate as v3, the slack gate on speed knobs, after the v2 realms read a service tradeoff on the Physics realm
and the tower. That gate is the closed circle applied to a muscle's physics: an axis that is busy more than half the time
at full speed has no slack to spend, and a law that spent it anyway would be spending energy for nothing; with the gate,
every organism reads superior within its guardrails and zero muscles read worse (`results/realms/REALMS.md`). On real
software the same law, read through the plug and the read-back, is the law of the Kubernetes, database, broker and cache
tables, with their gains and their losses. The first opening, the basin's negative side, remains open and documented: it
would be a new version with its own proof, and no result depends on it.


## 11. The Tracking Theorem



This page proves the internal tracking result of the canonical engine (`symmetric_verified`, mechanism id in
`results/MECHANISM_IDENTITY.json`) in four steps, from the continuous law to the code as executed. Each statement
carries one evidence class (see `docs/EVIDENCE_LEDGER.md`): **T** proved here, **V** checked by computation over a
finite, frozen set (`tools/tracking_bounds.py` → `results/TRACKING_BOUNDS.json`).

What this page establishes is **internal**: inside the declared model, the controller conveys U to its target
sigma. It does not establish that sigma is the right target for any outside plant, that the telemetry map is right,
that any actuator mapping (HPA, GPU, CPU) is right, any energy saving, production performance, or stability of the
whole forced six-state system. Target correctness and target conveyance are separate obligations; this page carries
only the second.

### Setting

U channel of equation (2): `dU/dt = f_U(x, t) + u`, with the uncontrolled drift

    f_U(x, t) = mu U (1 − U²) − (dE/dt) / E_max − lambda_U U

and the bounded cancellation-plus-proportional controller (`omnicompass/core.py`, `control_command`)

    u = sat(−f_U(x, t) + KP (sigma − U)),   sat(v) = max(−u_max, min(u_max, v)),   KP = 12, u_max = U_AUTHORITY = 25.

Tracking error `e = U − sigma`, sigma in {−1, +1}.

### Theorem 1 (T). Unsaturated tracking

On the unsaturated region `Omega_unsat = { x : |−f_U(x, t) − KP e| <= u_max }`, `de/dt = −KP e`. Along any interval
spent in `Omega_unsat`, `e(t) = e(t0) exp(−KP (t − t0))`, and `V = e²/2` satisfies `dV/dt = −KP e² < 0` for `e ≠ 0`.

*Proof.* Inside `Omega_unsat` the saturation is inactive, so `dU/dt = f_U − f_U + KP (sigma − U) = −KP e`; since sigma
is constant, `de/dt = dU/dt`. The solution and `dV/dt = e de/dt = −KP e²` follow. ∎

This is a statement about intervals inside `Omega_unsat` only; it is not global convergence.

### Theorem 2 (T). The saturated case, under a declared drift bound

**Assumption D.** Along the trajectory, `|f_U(x(t), t)| <= F_bar < u_max`.

Under D:
1. If saturation is active with `e < 0`, then `u = +u_max` and `de/dt = f_U + u_max >= u_max − F_bar > 0`; symmetrically
   for `e > 0`. So `dV/dt <= −(u_max − F_bar) |e| < 0` wherever saturation is active.
2. With Theorem 1, `V` is strictly decreasing wherever `e ≠ 0`, saturated or not; `e` never changes sign (at `e = 0`
   the command is unsaturated because `F_bar < u_max`, so `e = 0` is an equilibrium of the error dynamics).
3. Any saturated stretch ends within `(|e(t0)| − e*) / (u_max − F_bar)` time units, `e* = (u_max − F_bar) / KP`; the
   ball `|e| <= e*` lies inside `Omega_unsat` and is forward invariant, and inside it the decay is exponential at rate KP.

*Proof of 1.* Saturation with `u = +u_max` means `−f_U − KP e > u_max`, so `−KP e > u_max + f_U >= u_max − F_bar > 0`,
so `e < 0`, and `de/dt = f_U + u_max >= u_max − F_bar`. The other side is symmetric. 2 and 3 follow from 1 and
Theorem 1, and `|−f_U − KP e| <= F_bar + KP |e| <= u_max` on the ball. ∎

**Where D holds (T).** On the declared box — parameters in `PARAMETER_RANGES`, `E0` in [0, 1], `|U| <= 1.1` — equation
(1) keeps E in `[(beta − c)/alpha_E, (beta + c)/alpha_E]` widened to hold E0 (the right side of (1) points inward at
both ends, because `|v_eff| <= c`), so `|E| <= 7/4.2`, `|dE/dt| <= 4.2·|E| + 2 + 5 <= 14`, and

    F_bar = 6 · 2/(3√3) + 14 / 1 + 0.5 · 1.1 = 16.86 < 25 = u_max.

Because e keeps its sign and `|e|` does not grow (continuous time), U stays between U0 and sigma, so `|U| <= 1` and the
box is self-consistent for the nearest-basin target. **Theorem 2 therefore holds globally over the declared box, in
continuous time.** The actuator can still saturate: `|raw| <= F_bar + KP |e0|` can exceed 25 when `|e0|` is near 1.

**Checked (V).** Over the 500 frozen fixtures: observed `max |f_U|` = 6.84 (nearest target), 7.01 (wrong target), each
under that fixture's own bound (max 8.99) and under 16.86; saturated micro steps 0 of 100 000 (nearest target), 5 of
100 000 (wrong target).

### Theorem 3 (T with a computed constant). The executed sampled-data controller

The code does not run the continuous law. Per micro step `h = MICRO_DT = 0.01`, it computes `u_k` from `x_k`, holds it
through the four stages of one RK4 step (zero-order hold), and takes `x_(k+1) = F_h(x_k, u_k)`. There is no overwrite of U
after the step, no projection onto a basin, no state replacement.

Integrating the U equation over one held interval,

    e_(k+1) = e_k + h (f_U(x_k) + u_k) + ∫_(t_k)^(t_k+h) (f_U(x(t)) − f_U(x_k)) dt + tau_k

with `tau_k` the RK4 truncation error. Unsaturated, `f_U(x_k) + u_k = −KP e_k`, so

    e_(k+1) = rho e_k + d_k,   rho = 1 − h KP = 0.88,   |d_k| <= (h²/2) sup|df_U/dt| + |tau_k| =: epsilon_h.

Then by induction `|e_k| <= rho^k |e_0| + (1 − rho^k)/(1 − rho) · epsilon_h`, and the error enters and stays in the
neighbourhood `|e| <= epsilon_h / (1 − rho)`.

The proof above is exact given epsilon_h. **epsilon_h itself is computed, not proved (V):** the largest `|d_k|` over
every micro step of the 500 frozen fixtures is 0.00378 (nearest target), giving the ultimate bound 0.0315, inside
`BASIN_TOL` = 0.10 that CONVEY-5 and CERT-10 test. With the target aimed wrong, epsilon_h = 0.0243 (dominated by the
long transient, which includes the 5 saturated steps) and the bound 0.20 is wider than the basin — a conservative
bound; the fixtures still certify 500 of 500.

What the discrete execution does **not** inherit: the continuous monotone decay. Within the band, `|e|` grew on 27 061
of 100 000 micro steps and e changed sign 747 times — the sampled controller dithers inside `epsilon_h / (1 − rho)`.

**CONVEY and CERT.** They are dwell checks against a declared neighbourhood (`|U − sigma| <= 0.10` for 5 and 10
consecutive macro steps). Theorem 3 says why they pass when the bound sits inside the neighbourhood. They are not an
external certification.

### Theorem 4 (T continuous; V discrete). Admissibility

Admissible set for a fixture with parameters p and initial state x0:

    A = { x : E in [E_lo, E_hi],  |U − sigma| <= |U0 − sigma|,  S between S0 and S_plus(p) }

`E_lo, E_hi` as in Theorem 2; `S_plus` the stable root of equation (6).

- **Continuous (T).** A is forward invariant: E by the inward-pointing field at both ends; U by Theorem 2; S because
  equation (6) is the one-dimensional gradient flow of Phi, monotone toward `S_plus` from any `S0 > S_minus`
  (`s_admissibility` in `results/core_evidence.json`: 500 of 500 fixtures start above `S_minus`).
- **Discrete (V).** For the executed map `F_h(x, C(x))`, every micro step of every fixture: `x_k in A` implied
  `x_(k+1) in A` — 0 failures in 100 000 steps, target nearest or wrong. This is a finite verification on the frozen
  fixtures, not a proof over the box. An interval-arithmetic proof over the whole box is **open (O)**.

### What remains open (O)

- Global stability of the forced six-state system (E, I_U, S, B are not all covered above).
- A proved (not computed) epsilon_h over the declared box, and discrete invariance over the box.
- The inheritance / intertwining residual against an outside plant: instrumented (`tools/gpu_reps.py`,
  representation fidelity), not yet measured on a real card.
- The printed configuration (`printed_eight_line`) is not covered by this page: its U drift is logistic, not the
  double well, and needs its own bound (`docs/CANONICAL_ENGINE.md`).

## 12. The Conveyance Law



### 1. What the manuscript says, read as mechanism

| Source | Text | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| Ch. 29 §8 | "E_system = E + U + S + B … dE_system/dt = 0 (over full cycle). Energy redistributes. Energy reorganizes. Energy does not diverge." | The budget (site watts, cluster cores) is **conserved**: it is moved between organs, never created. |
| Ch. 31 §4 | "Redistribution B acts as mediator between the baths. When E grows locally, B increases to distribute gradients." | Budget flows **down the gradient of need**: from organs holding surplus to organs in deficit. |
| Ch. 31 §5 | "eigenvalues of the coupled system must remain bounded … Re(λᵢ) ≤ 0" | The flow must have a proof of convergence, not a tuned damper. |
| Ch. 30 §5-7 | "Redistribution surge … channels stored deviation into expansion … controlled release … No discontinuity." | A **reserve** is held and released **continuously** to organs at their limit. There is no on/off. |
| Ch. 29 §6 | "Backpressure develops through S … Compression is … structured inward rotation." | When need falls, surplus is **pulled back** smoothly. Budget nobody needs is not spent. |
| App. J | "the engine can only act through what you expose" | Organs keep their own mechanisms. The law sets only each organ's share of the budget. |

### 2. The law

**Notation.**
- Organs i = 1..n share a budget A.
- Organ i holds allocation aᵢ and has need dᵢ: the budget that serves its work at the engine's utilisation target ρ.
- Its deficit (local deviation) is

  eᵢ = dᵢ / (ρ aᵢ) − 1    (eᵢ > 0: needs juice; eᵢ < 0: holds surplus)

**The redistribution mediator:**

  daᵢ/dt = κ aᵢ (eᵢ − ē),    ē = Σⱼ aⱼ eⱼ / A

### 3. Properties and proofs

**P1. Conservation.**
- Σᵢ daᵢ/dt = κ (Σᵢ aᵢeᵢ − ē Σᵢ aᵢ) = κ (A ē − ē A) = 0.
- The budget is moved, never created, as in Ch. 29 §8.

**P2. Gradient flow with a Lyapunov function.**
- Substitute eᵢ: aᵢ(eᵢ − ē) = dᵢ/ρ − aᵢ D/(ρA), where D = Σ dᵢ.
- So daᵢ/dt = (κ/ρ)(dᵢ − aᵢ D/A).
- This is the Shahshahani gradient on the simplex Σ aᵢ = A of F(a) = Σᵢ (dᵢ/ρ) ln aᵢ. The Shahshahani metric weights
  by 1/aᵢ, and ∂F/∂aᵢ = dᵢ/(ρ aᵢ), so aᵢ(∂F/∂aᵢ − mean) is exactly the flow above.
- Along the flow dF/dt = Σᵢ (1/aᵢ)(daᵢ/dt)² · (ρ/κ) ≥ 0.
- F is strictly concave, so F is a Lyapunov function and the flow cannot cycle.

**P3. Global exponential convergence.**
- The ODE in P2 is linear: aᵢ(t) = aᵢ* + (aᵢ(0) − aᵢ*) e^(−κDt/(ρA)), with aᵢ* = A dᵢ/D.
- The Jacobian is −(κD/(ρA)) I on the simplex, so every eigenvalue is −κD/(ρA) < 0. This meets Re(λ) ≤ 0 of Ch. 31 §5
  strictly.
- At the equilibrium every organ has the same deficit e* = D/(ρA) − 1. None is starved while another idles.
- `replicator_step` integrates it exactly, in closed form, for any step size.

**P4. Bounds (floors, ceilings, the budget).**
- Allocations are projected onto {loᵢ ≤ aᵢ ≤ hiᵢ, Σ aᵢ ≤ A}.
- The projection is water-filling: organs at a bound keep it, and the rest share the remainder in proportion.
- Budget an organ cannot use (it is at its need or its ceiling) is not spent.

**P5. Reserve and surge.**
- The dual-bath rate channel (the rate tracker) projects the rise in need over one actuation delay:
  R = Σᵢ max(0, ḋᵢ), capped at A/2. R is held back.
- After the flow, R is released continuously to organs whose deficit stays positive, in proportion to their shortfall
  and up to their ceilings.
- This is the controlled release of Ch. 30: continuous state, no switch.

### 4. Evidence
**Mathematics in code.** `tests/test_conveyance.py` (in `verify.py`) checks 20,000 random systems:
- P1 conservation to 1e-9;
- P2, F never decreases;
- P3, the trajectory equals the closed form;
- P4, bounds and budget.

It also runs 2,000 systems over 30 steps and checks the full law never exceeds the budget or breaks a floor. That test
found and fixed one real bug: an organ whose need fell below its device floor was given a ceiling under that floor.

**Simulation.** `hardware/site_exchange.py`: four GPU groups of 16 H100-class GPUs share one site budget (MLPerf gamma).
Held-out seed 929292, 48 scenarios per budget. Results: `results/hardware/SITE_EXCHANGE_HELDOUT_*.json`.

| Site budget (share of TDP) | 70% | 60% | 50% |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Site-budget violation minutes, native / independent / **conveyance** | 10.5 / 1.5 / **0** | 45.6 / 10.5 / **0** | 106.1 / 31.3 / **0** |
| Energy (kWh), native / static split / independent / **conveyance** | 142.5 / 117.6 / 104.1 / **103.8** | 139.1 / 107.9 / 103.5 / **102.0** | 127.3 / 97.1 / 101.0 / **96.4** |
| Backlog minutes, static split (the arm that also keeps the budget) / **conveyance** | 32.0 / **1.0** | 89.7 / **8.9** | 187.3 / **72.2** |

**Reading.**
- **Keeping the budget.** Conveyance is the only dynamic arm that never exceeds the site budget.
- **Energy.** It uses the least energy at every budget.
- **Against the only other arm that keeps the budget (static split):** 31-115 fewer backlog minutes.
- **At tight budgets, native and independent sizing show less backlog,** but only by drawing power over the site limit
  for 10-106 minutes, which in a facility trips breakers.
- **When the budget is below total need,** conveyance shares the shortage in proportion to need. That is the unique
  stable point of P3: fair, and not a choice of weights.

**CPU and GPU on one budget.** `hardware/node_exchange.py`: the same law with CPU organs beside the GPU organs. Four
groups, each two 8-GPU servers (16 H100-class GPUs, 4 CPU sockets); each unit of GPU work needs 0.35 of the CPUs at
full clock to feed it; demand 1.6x the plant traces (the GPUs are held back by the budget, not by work). Arms:
- **S** today's practice: every GPU at one fixed cap low enough that the site fits even with every CPU at maximum;
- **XM** conveyance among the GPUs, counting the CPUs' last measured draw;
- **XC** conveyance over CPU and GPU organs together: each CPU group is held to the clock its feeding work needs, and
  the watts it no longer holds flow to the GPU groups in deficit.

Seed 515151, 24 scenarios. Results: `results/hardware/NODE_EXCHANGE_*.json`. XC against S, paired:

| Site budget (share of GPU TDP + CPU maximum) | 60% | 70% | 80% |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Work served | **+5.7%** | **+3.6%** | **+1.4%** |
| Backlog minutes | −15.8% | −27.5% | −17.8% |
| 95th-percentile latency factor | −39.6% | −43.6% | −35.2% |
| Site-budget violation minutes, native / S / XM / **XC** | 195.8 / 0 / 3.9 / **0** | 140.9 / 0 / 6.2 / **0** | 61.8 / 0 / 5.3 / **0** |

**Reading.**
- **More work from the same building.** The tighter the budget, the more the CPUs' unused watts are worth to the GPUs.
- **Holding the CPUs is what makes the hand-over safe.** Counting the CPUs' measured draw (XM) serves about as much,
  but goes over the budget for 4-6 minutes in every setting: a CPU can rise between one reading and the next. XC holds
  each CPU to its allocation, so the watts it gives up are really free, and it never goes over.
- **Most of the gain is the CPUs' reserve, not their clock.** Against XM, XC gains ~1% work per kWh; against S, the
  watts a fixed plan must keep for CPUs that might peak are what the GPUs receive.
- The same holds for the least and most favourable MLPerf gamma fits, and for CPU shares 0.2 and 0.6 (+2.3% to +4.2%
  work at the 70% budget), `tests/test_node_exchange.py` checks N1-N4 in `verify.py`.

### 5. What is not claimed
- This is a simulation on declared device physics.
- The live levers that would carry it are GPU power limits (`nvidia-smi -pl`, DCGM), RAPL package limits, and pod CPU
  limits under a namespace budget. They exist in `omni_controller/muscles.py`, but the exchange between them has not
  run on hardware.

## 13. Formal Status of the Mathematics



Not a global-stability proof of the forced six-state system. Proofs and their evidence classes:
`docs/TRACKING_THEOREM.md`; every statement's class: `docs/EVIDENCE_LEDGER.md`.

Held:

- Isolated S-flow is the gradient of Phi (same formula in both cores).
- (T) Unsaturated: dU/dt = KP (sigma − U); V = e²/2 has dV/dt = −KP e² on that channel (Theorem 1).
- (T) Saturated, with the U drift bounded by F_bar < U_AUTHORITY: V decreases wherever e ≠ 0; over the declared
  parameter box F_bar = 16.86 < 25, so this holds over the box in continuous time (Theorem 2).
- (T, constant computed) Sampled-data RK4 controller: e_(k+1) = 0.88 e_k + d_k; with epsilon_h computed over the
  frozen fixtures (V), the ultimate bound 0.0315 lies inside the 0.10 basin (Theorem 3).
- (T continuous, V discrete) Admissible box forward invariant (Theorem 4).

Open:

- epsilon_h and discrete invariance proved over the whole box (interval arithmetic).
- Inheritance embedding / intertwining residual against a real plant (Closed Structure Def. 11.1): instrumented in
  the GPU bench (`tools/gpu_reps.py`, representation fidelity), not yet measured on a card.
- Mapping of monograph Theorem 5.6 onto (E,U,I_U,S,B).
- A tracking bound for printed_eight_line (logistic U drift).

Default core remains symmetric_verified (mechanism id in `results/MECHANISM_IDENTITY.json`).

## 14. The Mechanism of Action



Every statement here is tied to code in this repository, and the measured numbers are reproduced by
`python tools/mechanism.py`, which writes `results/MECHANISM_OF_ACTION.json`. The engine files are frozen. Their SHA-256
hashes are checked by `verify.py`.

### 1. The state: six numbers that describe the whole system

| Symbol | Name | What it stands for in a data centre |
|---|---|---|
| E | energy / excitation | how hard the system is being driven: queues, overload, power, heat |
| U | order parameter | how healthy and settled the system is: +1 healthy basin, -1 failed basin |
| I_U | integrated need | unmet need accumulated over time: memory of pressure that has not been relieved |
| S | stress | slow structural stress from heat, power, network, security, staleness |
| B, B_dot | bath and its rate | a damped oscillator driven by stress: the slow "tide" of physical load |

### 2. The equations (omnicompass/core.py, lines 5-12)

```
(1) dE/dt    = -alpha_E E + beta_int + beta_ext + v_eff
(2) dU/dt    = mu U (1 - U^2) - (dE/dt)/E_max - lambda_U U + u,          |u| <= 25
(3) dI_U/dt  = (1 - U) - sigma_1 E - delta S - lambda_I I_U
(4) v_eff    = cos(omega_B t / 2) * c * tanh(lambda_0 + lambda_1 (U - 0.5) + lambda_2 S)
(5) Phi(S)   = alpha_s S^2 / 2 + beta_s S^3 / 4 - delta S
(6) dS/dt    = -dPhi/dS = delta - alpha_s S - (3/4) beta_s S^2
(7) dB/dt    = B_dot ;   dB_dot/dt = gamma_c delta S - (omega_B / Q_B) B_dot - omega_B^2 B
(8) R_B[n]   = finite-difference audit of (7), never fed back
```

Each term does one job:

- **(1) Energy.** Energy decays at rate alpha_E = 3.487. It is driven by two forcings: internal pressure `beta_int` (queue and
  overload) and external pressure `beta_ext` (power, heat, network, staleness, security). The drive term `v_eff` (4) is
  bounded by `c` through the hyperbolic tangent, so no input can drive E without limit. This is the saturation (the tanh
  "speed limit"): however extreme the observation, the engine's response rate is capped at c = 1.
- **(2) Order.** `mu U (1 - U^2)` is a double-well (bistable) drift with two stable basins, U = +1 (healthy) and
  U = -1 (failed), and an unstable ridge at U = 0. A rise in energy (`dE/dt`) pushes U out of the healthy basin. `u` is
  the bounded control input.
- **(3) Integrated need.** I_U grows while U is below 1 (the system is not settled). It is reduced by energy and stress
  already being dealt with, and it leaks at lambda_I = 0.719. It is the engine's memory of unrelieved pressure.
- **(5)-(6) Stress.** A cubic potential (the "well in the basin"). S rolls downhill to its stable root. This is the
  slowest restoring force.
- **(7) Bath.** A damped harmonic oscillator (natural frequency omega_B = 1, quality Q_B = 2.5) driven by stress. It turns
  stress into a smooth, lagged "tide". It is the only second-order element.
- **(8) Audit.** The bath equation is re-checked numerically every step. The check is never fed back.

Integration: classical 4th-order Runge-Kutta, 10 micro-steps of 0.01 per macro step (`rk4_step`, `macro_step`). The C++
twin matches the Python to 3.6e-15 on 500 reference trajectories.

### 3. From telemetry to state (omnicompass/adapter.py, `observe_vector`, `assimilate`)

Each decision the telemetry is normalised to nine observations: q (queue), load, power, thermal, network, drift, stale,
security, conflict. An observed state is computed from them:

```
E_obs   = 0.25 q + 0.18 max(0, load - 0.85) + 0.16 power + 0.13 thermal + 0.10 network + 0.08 drift + 0.06 conflict + 0.04 stale
U_obs   = 1 - (0.27 q + 0.18 power + 0.16 thermal + 0.12 network + 0.12 drift + 0.10 conflict + 0.05 stale)
S_obs   = 0.36 thermal + 0.28 power + 0.18 network + 0.10 security + 0.08 stale - 0.20 q
B_obs   = 0.52 power + 0.26 thermal + 0.22 drift
I_obs   = q + drift + conflict
beta_int = 0.58 q + 0.42 max(0, load - 0.75)        beta_ext = 0.33 power + 0.27 thermal + 0.20 network + 0.12 stale + 0.08 security
```

The state is blended toward the observed state with weight a = 0.339: `x <- (1 - a) x + a x_obs`. It is then evolved
by one macro step (0.1 engine time units) of equations (1)-(7).

### 4. From state to action (the allocation law, `Governor.step`)

```
push     = u(x) / 25,  u(x) = clip(-f_U(x) + 12 (1 - U), -25, 25)        equation (2)'s controller, evaluated, not applied
rho*     = clamp(rho0 - kI I_U - kE E, rho_min, rho0)                      target utilisation (the HPA target)
n_req    = ceil(n load / rho*) + ceil(kq q n)                               machines wanted
release  only while push <= push_release (the engine reports convergence), after band and dwell
cap      = clamp(cap_now load (1 + margin), cap_min, 1) when calm and U >= U_gate; 1 under backlog;
           always <= 1 - cap_gain max(0, B - B_cap)                         the bath limits the power cap
change   permitted only while U >= U_gate and no security block
rollback authorised if S >= S_rollback, U is falling, or a security block is seen
```

### 5. Which equation drives which muscle

| Muscle | Engine quantity used | Where |
|---|---|---|
| HPA target (pods) | rho* from I_U and E, equations (1) and (3) | adapter `Governor.step`; live `omni_controller/controller.py` |
| Node pool (machines) | n_req from load, queue and rho*; release gated by push from equation (2) | same |
| Power cap (pod CPU limits, CPU frequency, GPU limit) | cap from U gate and bath B, equation (7) | same; `omni_controller/muscles.py` |
| Rollout guard | change_permitted (U), rollback (S, dU) | `muscles.py` |
| Security hold | security observation raises S and blocks expansion | adapter, shield |
| Speed-first law | rho* for pods; push gates machine release | `omnicompass/speed.py` |
| Right-sizing | rho* sizes CPU; E widens the memory margin; push gates scale-in | `omnilab/rightsize.py` |
| Cold start | rho* sizes instances; I_U sets how long to keep warm | `omnilab/coldstart.py` |
| GPU packing | I_U pre-warms nodes; push gates power-off | `omnilab/gpupack.py` |
| Training power | E tightens the applied ramp limit under sustained grid stress | `omnilab/powersmooth.py` |
| GPU health | S and E shorten the checkpoint interval | `omnilab/health.py` |
| Cooling | E widens the inlet-temperature margin | `omnilab/cooling.py` |
| Inference | the full allocation law (node_delta) sizes replicas | `omnilab/inference.py` |
| Agent containment | I_U throttles; the security observation contains | `omnilab/containment.py` |
| VM energy | I_U and E raise the learning rate when attribution goes stale | `omnilab/vmenergy.py` |

### 6. Measured: what the equations actually do inside the governor

Measured on a real observation stream (fleet plant, web services, fleet mode, 360 decisions):

| Mode (eigenvalue of the Jacobian at the operating point) | Time constant | In decisions |
|---|---|---|
| -7.90 | 0.13 | 1.3 |
| -3.10 | 0.32 | 3.2 |
| -0.72 | 1.39 | 13.9 |
| -0.20 +/- 0.98i (the bath) | 5.0, period 6.4 | 50, rings every 64 decisions |
| -0.17 | 6.0 | 60 |

- **Every mode is stable** (all real parts negative). The operating point is a stable equilibrium inside the healthy basin:
  E = 0.095, U = 0.976, S = 0.315, B = 0.10. This is the basin keeping everything in, stated as mathematics.
- **Per decision, the equations and the observation move the state about equally.** Across all six variables the
  equations contribute 45-50% of each step's movement and the observation blend the rest.
- **Equation (2)'s control input u is not applied during governance.** The engine evolves open-loop (u = 0). The control
  law is evaluated only to produce `push`, which decides when capacity may be released.
- **Compute:** about 95 microseconds per decision in Python, and about 2.9 microseconds in the C++ twin.

### 7. What this explains, and what it points to

- **Why "engine off" scores close to "engine on" in the muscle benchmarks.** With the equations frozen, the observation
  blend still moves the state. Both versions are then low-pass filters of the same telemetry. The engine's fast modes
  (1-3 decisions) behave almost like the blend itself. Its distinct contribution is its slow memory: I_U (14 decisions),
  S (60) and the bath (period 64 decisions). The muscle mappings mostly read E and rho*, which live on the fast modes.
- **The engine clock is not matched to the workload's rhythm.** One decision advances engine time by 0.1. At 60-second
  decisions the bath rings every 64 minutes, but web demand has a 24-hour rhythm and training power a 2-second one. This
  is a wiring choice in the adapter (engine time per decision), not a property of the equations.
- **The controller in equation (2) is unused as an actuator.** Wiring its output u (or U's trajectory under u) directly
  to the actuators is the unexplored way to "let the math do the work".

Three wiring experiments follow directly. None changes a single equation:

1. **Clock matching.** Set engine time per decision so that the bath's natural period equals the workload's rhythm.
   The oscillator in (7) then carries the cycle and can anticipate it.
2. **Slow-mode actuation.** Drive machines from I_U, S and B (the memory modes) rather than E (a fast mode).
3. **Closed-loop actuation.** Apply equation (2)'s u and use its magnitude, not only its sign, as the actuator command.

Each is testable in the existing harness against every platform in the league (tuning/league.py), and will be tested
there.


### The pedals: idle, gas, brake, reset, and the kill switch

Omni-Compass drives a system the way a self-driving car drives itself: it feels, gauges and adjusts, with nobody in
the seat. The words below are used the same way everywhere in this repository.

**Two names only.** **native** is the system as it runs on its own (Kubernetes and its autoscalers, the card's
firmware, CityLearn's controller). **omni** is Omni-Compass on top of native: the same native system, with Omni-Compass
governing it. Omni-Compass never runs instead of native, only on top of it, so every comparison is native against omni.

**The modes.** Off (manual): Omni-Compass not driving, native runs alone. Watching: Omni-Compass reads every gauge and
logs what it would do, and writes nothing. Autopilot: the pedals below. Cruise and the emergency brake: for work that
comes as a pile.

| Term | Meaning | In the code |
|---|---|---|
| **Idle** | No foot on the gas or the brake: calm traffic, the engine running at its floor (two machines in service, ready) | `MIN_NODES`, the floor of the staging law (8.8) |
| **Gas** | Ramping up: traffic climbs and capacity is added at once, never held back; the whole cluster can take work the instant it is needed | (8.3); a lower HPA target is never limited |
| **Brake** | Ramping down: traffic falls and capacity is eased off a step at a time, never below idle | (8.4)-(8.5); coasting, rule 6 |
| **Reset** | The brake held to the floor: every setting the governor ever wrote is handed back to where native had it, read back, and the record removed; the next run starts fresh. Every benchmark arm ends with one and checks it | the reset file (`--kill-file`, a name kept for compatibility), `Controller.restore` |
| **Cruise** | A pile of work waiting for a place: every machine in service, held there without second-guessing, until the line has been empty for two decisions | rule 7, `--cruise-after` |
| **Emergency brake** | The work is done and demand is at zero (the service at its least pods, wanting no more, at half its target or less): straight to idle (the floor) in one move, every safety check still holding | rule 8, `--brake-demand`, amendment 9 |
| **Kill switch** | Security only: one switch in a human hand that turns Omni-Compass's governing off across the whole system at once, for anything rogue or anyone trying to drive a system through Omni-Compass's brain | `omnicompass/master.py`, `tools/omni_switch.py off` |

The fuel cut-off point (the floor) is a number the operator sets; the brake never takes the system below it, however
hard it is pressed. Earlier dated records, and the sealed original engine files, call the reset a "kill switch"; they
are kept word for word.

### 8. The staging law: machines on and off in order, with demand that moves

Demand climbs, spikes, eases part way, climbs again and settles to idle. The staging law decides how many machines are
in service at every decision, and which ones, so that capacity follows demand up at once and comes back down only as
far as it safely can. It is the compass law (`omnicompass/compass_law.py`) applied to the machine pool
(`omni_controller/controller.py`), the release gate (`omnicompass/nervous_system.py node_release_gate`), the verdict
(`omnicompass/verdict.py`) and the actuator (`scripts/kind_nodepool.sh`). Every symbol below is a line of that code.

**Position and force.** The service reading r (the 95th-percentile response time, or the pressure that stands for it)
is placed in its band [lo, hi], where hi is the response line:

    p = (r - lo) / (hi - lo),      v = s v + (1 - s) (p - p_prev) / dt                       (8.1)
    F = A                                       if p >= 1 - c        (fail up, past the wall)
    F = A tanh( (kp (p - p0) + kd v) / A )      otherwise; F = 0 if F < 0 while v > 0 and p > p0   (8.2)

with the band's center p0 = 0.5, cushion c = 0.05, authority A = 1, kp = 1 and kd = max(0, 2 sqrt(kp tau / dt) - 1) dt
(critical damping for a muscle that answers in tau seconds). F > 0 asks for capacity, F < 0 offers it back.

**How many machines.** With n machines in service now, n_nat the count native ran, m the floor (two by default, `MIN_NODES`) and M the
machines that exist (every machine usable; an operator may hold whole machines back with `NODE_CUSHION`, off by
default), every count stays in m <= n' <= M. The protection is not a machine sitting out: it is the band inside every
machine. Capacity is added at 95% of the response line, before the line is reached (8.2-8.3), and a machine goes back
only if the ones left still run at or under the engine's utilisation target rho (8.5): a margin spread over all of
them.

    up      n' = min(M, max(m, n + 1))                              if p >= 1 - c                     (8.3)
    down    n' = max(m, n - 1)                                      if F < R and p < p0 and the verdict
                                                                    allows n_nat - (n - 1) and the gate G holds  (8.4)
    hold    n' = n                                                  otherwise

with the release threshold R = -0.2. Up is immediate and is never gated. Down is one machine per decision, never below the floor, and only
when every term of the release gate holds:

    G = [n > 1] and [nothing pending] and [pods not scaling up] and [no breach now] and
        [ used / ((n - 1) x per_node) <= rho ] and [contraction authority] and [every sense live] and
        [the last machine command landed]                                                          (8.5)

rho is the engine's utilisation target: after a machine goes back, what remains runs at or under rho. The verdict
(section 7 of the GPU preregistration, `omnicompass/verdict.py`) allows a machine count below native only after a
paired trial showed the service at that count at most 2% worse than at the count before; that 2% is where the trigger
sits, inside the engine.

**This is hysteresis by construction.** The up condition (p >= 0.95) and the down condition (p < 0.5 with F < -0.2)
are far apart, so a demand that hovers never makes machines flap; a spike crosses the wall and adds a machine at once;
a dip has to be deep, calm and sustained before one goes back, and then only one per decision. Between the two, the
count holds.

**Which machines.** The actuator orders the pool:

    idle   the open machine with the fewest serving pods, then the fewest pods, goes first;
           it is marked prefer-not (PreferNoSchedule) and its pods first to go (pod-deletion-cost), so the
           autoscaler's own scale-down empties whole machines; no pod is moved, evicted or restarted   (8.6)
    wake   the idle machine still carrying the most work goes first (it is warm); the mark comes off and it is in
           service at once, with no boot                                                          (8.7)
    floor  two machines always in service (MIN_NODES, the operator may set more), ready for a spike  (8.8)
    margin  every machine usable; the cushion is the band inside each one (the 5% before the line, and rho), not a
            whole machine held out                                                                 (8.9)

An idled machine stays powered and Ready at its floor (park_frac x idle power), never off: a pod that finds the open
machines full lands on it at once, so no request ever waits on a machine Omni-Compass idled. Where a node autoscaler
underneath really removes an empty machine (Azure's cluster autoscaler, Karpenter), that same order hands it the
emptiest machine first, and the bill falls with the machine.

**The same law on every discrete unit.** Machines are one case. In the muscle models (`realms/compass_arm.py
release_safe`), a cooling plant's chillers and a compute pool's machines follow the same law: one unit back only when
the units left cover the recent peak with headroom (RELEASE_MARGIN 0.6 for machines, 0.8 of a unit's capacity for
chillers), one at a time, and back at once when the wall is reached.

**What is proved, measured and open.** The order (8.6)-(8.8) is checked through the real actuator by
`tests/test_staging_order.py` (the emptiest idles first, the warmest wakes first, two always in service, every machine usable, no pod moved).
The gate (8.5) is checked by `tests/test_node_release_gate.py`. On real Kubernetes the law gave the same work 55-65%
faster on 29-36% fewer machines (sets 22-27) and 48% more work on the same machines (the capacity test); its run under
demand that wanders (up, spike, part way down, back up, idle) is in progress. Open: an order across different kinds of
unit (a battery before a generator, a CPU before a GPU) is not wired; each pool is ordered within itself.

### 9. The state each muscle carries, and the modes as a state machine

**9.1 The compass on a muscle is a dynamical system, so its state must persist.** On muscle i the compass carries
z_i = (p_i, v_i, x_i): the position of the service in its band, its velocity, and the knob's continuous value. At each
decision k, with reading r_k:

    p_k = (r_k - lo) / (hi - lo),   v_k = s v_{k-1} + (1 - s)(p_k - p_{k-1}) / dt,   F_k = F(p_k, v_k) by (8.2)    (9.1)
    x_{k+1} = clamp( x_k + sigma g(F_k) F_k (x_hi - x_lo), x_lo, x_hi ),   g = UP if F_k > 0 else DOWN          (9.2)

with x_0 the native value and sigma = +1 when a higher value is more capacity. Two properties depend on z persisting:
(a) the knob integrates the force, x_k - x_0 = sum_j sigma g F_j span (until the cover binds), so a calm muscle eases
step by step toward its cover; and (b) the damping term kd v_k needs p_{k-1}. If z were made fresh at every decision
(p_{k-1} = p_k, v = 0, x_k = x_0), (9.2) would collapse to x_{k+1} = clamp(x_0 + sigma g F(p_k, 0) span): a memoryless map
of the present reading, at most one step from native, with no damping. That is a different, weaker law. A renamed
attribute did exactly that on 2026-10-05; `tests/test_compass_arm.py` now fails if the compass is ever made twice on one
muscle.

**9.2 The modes.** The live controller is in exactly one mode at each decision. With q_k the pods waiting for a place,
u_k the scaling-up flag, c the cruise count (`--cruise-after`, 2), M the machine ceiling and m the floor:

    cruise on      q_j > 0 for the last c decisions                                                   (9.3)
    cruise off     q_j = 0 and not u_j for the last c decisions                                       (9.4)
    in cruise      n' = M; the service's autoscaler target held at the operator's own; the floor step
                   makes no read and no write                                                         (9.5)
    emergency brake (not cruising) q = 0, no breach, not u, every sensed service idle or at demand
                   <= b, the gate G (8.5) holds, every sense live, the last command landed:
                   n' = max(m, smallest n carrying the CPU in use at rho)                             (9.6)
    idle (a service at its floor)   I(h) := current = min = desired, and u_h <= target_h / 2          (9.7)
    gas / brake / idle             (8.3) / (8.4)-(8.5) / (8.8)

**9.3 Why cruise steps back (9.5).** In cruise every machine is already in service, n = M, so the floor step's only
action (raise n to the floor the waiting pods need) is empty: floor <= M = n. Its reads (every pod, every node, node
metrics, every HPA, each five seconds) carry no value of information, so removing them cannot change any action; they
only cost CPU and API-server time on the machines the queue is using. The service's response time is also confounded
in cruise: with a queue of other work holding the machines, a request waits on contended CPU, R = S / (1 - u_host), not on
the service's own pods. Reading that R as the service's own queue and adding pods would answer the wrong cause. So in
cruise Omni holds the machines and leaves the service to its own autoscaler. `tests/test_compass_controller.py` checks
that the floor step makes no API read during cruise; the controller before this rule made the full set of reads every
five seconds.

**9.4 Why idle is read from the autoscaler's floor (9.7).** A served service never reads zero: a health probe or a
client's keep-alive keeps one pod at a few percent of its request. In the batch test, one pod at about 10% of its request
read as demand 0.10, above b = 0.05, and the brake waited 15 minutes after the queue emptied. The autoscaler's own
floor is the observable of "no demand beyond the minimum": the pods it keeps are its minimum, it wants no more, and they
run under half the target. In the five frozen-engine web tests the service was never at its floor (0 of 5,102 readings),
so (9.7) changes nothing there.

**9.5 Reporting resolution.** A paired change smaller than one part in a million of the value
(|mean difference| <= 1e-6 |native|) is read "same", the number still shown. Below that, a difference is rounding in
floating point and in the models' accumulators, not behaviour; a deterministic run gives a zero-width interval around
it, which would otherwise read as proven.

**9.6 A lever is moved only where moving it can pay.** The compass decides how far and how fast. Whether a lever may
move at all is a property of the muscle's physics. Four cases, each derived from the muscle's own model and each its own
test:

- *Cooling power.* A zone's heat must leave it: over a run, the heat removed equals the heat made plus what the
  room's mass stores. A cap on cooling power q_max cannot remove less heat. It only lets the temperature drift above
  setpoint while the PI command grows, and the staging rule, units = ceil(command / (0.8 q_unit)), turns that command
  into more units and more fan power, p = q_c / COP + units x p_unit. So a lower cap never saves energy, and the lever
  stays native. (The setpoint, which changes the COP, and the units, which change fan power at the same heat, remain
  levers.)
- *A battery's reserve.* Energy D drawn from the cells below the operator's reserve saves D sqrt(eta) of grid import,
  and the deficit is bought back at D / sqrt(eta). The net, D (1 - eta) / sqrt(eta) (10.5% of D at eta = 0.90), is
  always positive. Spending the reserve is never an energy saving; it is the price of keeping the draw under the
  connection's limit. So the reserve is spent only at the wall (p >= 0.95) and only when the battery can cover the
  excess (0 < imp - p_lim <= p_batt). Otherwise the operator's reserve holds, and no round trip is paid for nothing.
- *A backup reserve (a UPS).* It is held for an outage, which the model does not contain, so spending it for a peak
  trades away the reason it exists. Never a lever.
- *A compute pool's power cap.* With throughput mu(c) proportional to c^eps and the autoscaler holding utilisation near its
  target u*, the energy per unit of work is e(c) = (p_idle / u* + p_dyn c) / mu(c). At c = 1, de/dc > 0 (a lower cap
  saves) if and only if

      eps < p_dyn / (p_idle / u* + p_dyn)                                                                 (9.8)

  At eps = 0.4 the cap saves on CPU hosts (threshold 0.62), GPUs (0.74), databases (0.51) and radio units (0.54). It
  costs energy where idle power dominates: a quantum computer's cryostat (0.19), a network switch (0.32), storage
  (0.26). There, running slower keeps the machines on longer: race to idle. In a deployment p_idle, p_dyn and the
  speed curve come from the machine's own specification.

- *A motion axis's effort cap.* It lowers the copper loss of a full-acceleration move, (J a_max / kt)^2 R, and stretches
  the move, which keeps paying the standing draw p_idle + b v_max^2. It moves only where the first exceeds the second: a
  reaction wheel (32 W against 5 W), not EV traction, a flight axis or a robot joint.
- *A machine released from a node pool.* A machine boots in minutes, and a burst that arrives in the meantime is served
  late. So a machine goes back only when the machines left cover the recent peak at 0.3 of the pool's own release level,
  the largest margin at which no pool is later than native (`results/realms/RELEASE_MARGIN_SWEEP.md`). This is the
  verdict of the live controller (section 8) in model form.

What a lever buys is labelled for what it is. Less work per energy, with no work lost and the time over the line
proven lower, is SERVICE IMPROVEMENT WITH ENERGY TRADEOFF, the mirror of ENERGY IMPROVEMENT WITH SERVICE TRADEOFF.
Without that proof it is WORSE.

## 15. The Engines and Their Audit

### Which engine is which



There is **one** engine. Every other engine-looking file in this repository is either its required C++ twin or a frozen
copy of where it came from. Nothing else runs.

| File | Role | Runs? |
|---|---|---|
| `omnicompass/core.py` | **The engine** (`symmetric_verified`): six states, eight lines, RK4 with microsteps. Everything Omni does goes through it. | yes |
| `cpp/src/core.cpp`, `cpp/include/omnicompass/core.hpp` | The same engine in C++. Required: `verify.py` checks it against the Python on every fixture. | yes (twin) |
| `docs/handoff/mathematics/omni_compass_engine_source_c527df2d.py` | The original source as handed over (sha256 `c527df2d…`). Kept unchanged as proof of origin and as the parameter authority. | no (frozen) |
| `reference/omni_compass_reference_engine.py` | The same original with comments stripped (`tools/strip_reference.py`); same program fingerprint (`reference/PROVENANCE.json`). | no (frozen) |

Fingerprints of the running engine, its parts and its twin: `results/MECHANISM_IDENTITY.json` and `RELEASE_MANIFEST.json`.
`verify.py` fails if any of them changes without a new seal.

#### Engines from outside packages, not adopted

Copies of this repository passed around as zips (the XPASS packages) carry changes that are **not** in the engine here:

- `batch_claim1.py` (in those zips, not in this tree): a vectorised variant that applies u during the RK4 step (CLAIM1). No C++ twin; not
  verified against the 500 fixtures.
- an adapter that defaults to CLAIM1, takes the target sign from the starting state and adds a disruption budget. Its
  C++ governor was only partly ported, which is where the reported Python/C++ mismatches came from.

None of these enter before the GPU confirmation run (the engine is frozen for it, `docs/GPU_PREREGISTRATION.md`). Any of
them can be adopted afterwards only as a full change: Python and C++ together, the parity tests and `verify.py` green,
and a new mechanism id.

#### The rule from here

One engine, one twin, two frozen originals. A new version **replaces** the old one in place, with a new seal; it is never
added beside it. Older states are in git history and `docs/HISTORY.md`, not in extra files.

| Reference Kubernetes HPA rule | `oc_hpa_desired_replicas` | `cpp/` HPA, pod reflex | `tests/test_cpp_hpa_parity.py` | exact |

#### Where my live wiring reads the engine differently from the source's own embodiment

**Evolution between decisions.** The source's compute embodiment advances the assimilated state *with* regulation
locked on basin +1. My live governor advances it with u = 0 and reads the regulation command separately, as the push
that gates every machine release.

- Both use the same equations.
- The difference is whether the regulation is applied to the state or only read from it.
- The pre-registered, frozen results were measured with u = 0. I keep that setting, and I report the difference here
  rather than change a frozen law mid-measurement.

# Part Three. The Physics: the Compass and the Nervous System

*Push and pull, the band and its cushions, the physics of a processor, and the two-way wires that carry the force from the brain to every muscle and back.*


## 16. The Compass: Push, Pull and the Two Forces


The compass (`omnicompass/compass_law.py`) is the law that carries the engine's push and pull to every muscle.

**Two bands.**
- **The cover**, a knob's hard range (the device's or the operator's lowest and highest setting). Every write is
  clipped to it. Nothing Omni-Compass computes can set a knob outside it.
- **The compass**, the service reading as a position from 0 (calm) to 1 (the service line). Omni-Compass pulls that
  position to the bottom of the compass, the middle (0.5 by default; an operator may set it lower for extra margin). The
  walls run from 0.05 to 0.95; the last 5% on each side, 10% in all, is cushion.

**The force.** F = A tanh((K_P (p - center) + K_D v) / A), where p is the position, v its rate of change, A the
authority.
- **Pull:** K_P (p - center), gentle near the bottom, stronger up the walls.
- **Push:** K_D v, the force that meets whatever is shoving the position, and the friction that stops it sloshing.
  With K_D at or above critical damping the position glides to the middle and stops, with no overshoot and no
  ringing. Overshoot is wasted energy: force spent going the wrong way and spent again coming back.
- **Smooth, never a hammer:** tanh bends the force over into its maximum instead of slamming into a wall.
- **Fail up:** past the 0.95 wall the up side goes to its full force at once and the down side may not act until the
  position is back inside the compass.

**Two forces: antagonist pairs.** Like the muscles of an arm, every plug has an up side (adds capacity, power,
cooling, speed) and a down side (takes it back), each with its own gain, because adding and taking back do not cost
the same: a new machine takes minutes to boot; giving one back is instant. Where a machine has two wires, each side
gets its own lever:

| Muscle | Up force | Down force |
|---|---|---|
| GPU card | clock ceiling raised | power limit lowered (the lid) |
| Kubernetes | scale out | scale in |
| Cooling | chiller on, colder setpoint | warmer setpoint, unit released |
| Battery | discharge | charge, reserve held |
| Vehicle, joint | motor effort | braking, regeneration |

**Why the GPU needs both wires.** A card's firmware boosts its clock as high as it may while there is work, and its
power limiter knocks the clock back each time the draw crosses the limit; on a busy card this happens many times a
second, at the top of the clock range where each extra step of speed costs the most watts. With one wire (the power
limit) a governor can only move the wall the boost pushes against. With two wires, the clock ceiling sets how high the
boost may climb and the power limit becomes a lid that rarely needs to act: the card runs at the bottom of its compass
instead of fighting itself at the top.

**What the card taught us.** Two rules make the difference between saving energy and spending the customer's time.
First, *race while work waits*: when the card is saturated, both wires go to full at once, so a burst is always served
at full speed; the compass paces only the slack between bursts. Second, *never slower than the card on its own*: the
governor learns, from the card's own meter, the clock and the draw the card reaches by itself while busy, and never
sets the clock ceiling or the lid under them. Without these rules the first real card saved 3.5% of its energy and
made the slowest answers 58.5% slower; with them, the modelled card saves energy with the slowest answers at native
speed or faster (section 16, and `docs/GPU_PREREGISTRATION.md`, amendments 6 and 7).

### 6.1 The same law on every stack, and what differs

The law is written once (`CompassLaw`), and three declared numbers fit it to a muscle: the **decision period** *dt*
(how often the governor decides), the muscle's **response time** tau (how long the service reading takes to follow the
lever), and the **cover**. From tau and *dt* the law derives its own damping gain, K_D = (2 sqrt(K_P tau / dt) − 1) dt,
which is critical damping for a first-order muscle under a proportional-derivative pull: the position glides to the
center and stops. Nothing else is tuned per stack. The table below is the complete list of the compass's settings on every
stack in this manual, so a referee can see that the "gains" differ only through the declared physics:

| Stack | Reading (the wire in) | Line | Center | Decision period | Response time | Cover of the knob |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Kubernetes, the HPA target | the mean response time of the latency window | the operator's SLO (500 ms) | 0.4 | 60 s | the pods' start time | [0.6 × the operator's target, the operator's target] |
| Kubernetes, the machines | the same, through the release gate and the verdict | the same | 0.4 | 60 s | a machine's wake | [the floor of 2, every machine] |
| PgBouncer, the pool size | time in the server plus time waiting for one, per transaction | 50 ms | 0.4 | 1 s | 2 s | [2, PostgreSQL's limit minus 10] |
| Kafka, the consumer count | the group's own end-to-end latency, mean of the last second | 500 ms | 0.4 | 1 s | 3 s (a rebalance) | [1, the topic's partitions] |
| Redis, the memory ceiling | the application's request latency, mean of the last second | 2 ms | 0.4 | 1 s | 2 s | [16 MB, 512 MB] |
| MongoDB, the storage-engine cache | the server's own mean read latency, last second | 2 ms | 0.4 | 1 s | 2 s | [256 MB, 2,048 MB] |
| A drone's cruise override | the drone's tracking error | 0.25 m, the declared safe error | 0.5 | one control tick (48 Hz) | 1 s | [1.0, 2.0] × the planner's cruise |
| A substation's tap | the bus voltage in its band | the band's edge | 0.5 | one solve | a week of evidence before a step down | the tap's own range, one tap per move |
| A robot axis's speed | the axis's tracking error against its takt | the declared error | 0.5 | one control step | the axis's response | the axis's own limits |
| A GPU's clock ceiling and lid | the mean response time of the last 5 s | the SLO | 0.4 | 2 s | the card's response | [the card's own busy clock, its top clock]; [the busy draw + 10%, the start limit] |

The center is 0.4 wherever the reading is a service time (the "service profile" of the Kubernetes adapter, so that the
service sits a little below the middle of its band with margin for a burst) and 0.5 where the reading is a physical
error. A **cushion** of ±0.05 in force moves nothing, so a reading that sits at the center with the usual jitter does not
make the knob chatter. These are the same numbers in every preregistration and every table; none was changed after a
result was seen.

### 6.2 Direction rules: how a force becomes a move

The force is a number between −1 and +1. Each stack turns it into a move on its knob by a direction rule declared in its
preregistration, always of the same shape: a positive force adds capacity in proportion to the force (ceil(force / 0.10)
notches, so full force adds ten notches at once, capped by the cover), a negative force takes one notch back per
decision, and only when the resource it would take is demonstrably idle (an idle consumer that read nothing in the last
second, an idle server the pooler itself shows idle, a cache with nothing evicted in the last second) and only after a
**dwell** of a few seconds since the last change, so a knob that was just moved is not moved back by its own transient.
At 95% of the line the knob **fails up**: every consumer the topic can use, the pooler's own setting handed back, a
quarter of the cache's cover added at once, the planner's own cruise, the card's own clocks. The up side is fast and the
down side is slow and gated because adding and taking back do not cost the same, and because a gain bought by taking
something back must be able to prove itself before it is kept.

### 6.3 The do-no-harm gates inside the law

Three gates sit inside the law itself, each a consequence of a loss seen on a tuning case and each disclosed in the
preregistration that carries it:

- **The verdict** (section 1.2): a slow knob moves only where a paired trial on the muscle shows no more than 2% cost.
- **The slack gate on speed knobs** (Omni v3): a motion axis that is busy more than half the time at full speed keeps its
  speed native, because spending its slack as speed when it has none would only cost energy. This gate is what turned
  the v2 "service tradeoff" on the Physics realm and the tower into "superior within guardrails" on v3, and it is the
  one rule that distinguishes v3 from v2.
- **The full-cache gate** (Redis): a miss in a cache with room to spare is a cold miss that no ceiling can mend, so the
  ceiling grows only while the cache is at 90% of it or more. On the tuning workload without that gate the law raised the
  ceiling to 500 MB while 21 MB were in use; with it, the ceiling follows the working set.

### 6.4 The profiles and the pedals

The compass has two **profiles**, service (the default) and batch, which differ only in what the pedals do with a pile of
work: in the service profile the law paces the slack; in the batch profile cruise puts every machine in service while
work waits for a place and the emergency brake takes them straight to the floor when the queue is done (section 1.3).
Both are written out in the Kubernetes preregistration (`docs/K8S_COMPASS_PREREGISTRATION.md`, rules 7 and 8, amendment
9), both ran in the batch test, and the result (section 16) is machines 19% to 23% fewer over the whole window and 29% to
35% fewer after the queue finished, with the queue itself finishing no later beyond the noise.


## 17. The Physics of a Processor


A GPU's firmware raises its clock one step at a time whenever there is work and room; each higher clock needs a higher
voltage, and dynamic power rises with the clock times the square of the voltage, so the top of the clock range is where
each extra step of speed costs the most watts. When the draw crosses the power limit, the firmware knocks the clock down
several steps; with room again, it climbs again. On a busy card this repeats many times a second. The clock saws against
the limit, the overshoots burn watts before the limiter catches them, and the card spends its time at the steepest part
of its power curve. The power is the burner; the cooling removes the heat at its own pace; the limiter turns the burner
down so the cooling can catch up, and the boost turns it back up.

The firmware does not aim at a balance point because it cannot see the job: it does not know whether the work is a
response due in milliseconds or a batch due overnight, the right point moves with the workload, the room and the chip,
and a limiter is simple to prove safe. The vendor default is set for maximum performance, and the electricity bill is the
customer's.

Omni-Compass sits on the customer's side, where the job's service line is known. It holds two wires: the clock ceiling
sets how high the boost may climb, and the power limit becomes a lid set just above what that ceiling draws. The boost
stops at the bottom of the compass instead of slamming into the wall; the limiter rarely needs to act. Every watt kept off
the chip is saved twice in a data center: once at the chip and again at the chillers that would have carried its heat.


## 18. The Two-Way Nervous System


Every muscle is wired both ways: a sensory wire in (its meters) and a motor wire out (its knob), with the read-back
closing the loop. Between them sits the nervous system (`omnicompass/nervous_system.py`), which decides how much
authority each organ has at each moment:

- **Expand is always allowed** (except under a security hold): adding capacity, power, cooling or protection never
  waits.
- **Contract needs calm and a clean service record:** giving anything back is allowed only while the organ is calm
  enough and service has been inside its line for the last three decisions; continuous organs give back at most the
  calm share of their surplus per decision; discrete organs one unit at a time, through a release gate.
- **Fail up:** while service is breached, the knob returns to native at once.
- **Blind means hold:** if a sense goes stale or unreadable, nothing is given back until it returns.

One brain reads every organ at once. Because one law sets every knob, no two muscles fight: when the GPU's watts turn
to heat, the cooling knob already knows it is coming; when pods scale up, the power envelope is ready.

### 7.1 Authority, and the release gate

Authority is how far the nervous system lets an organ move in one decision. It is granted from the engine's state
(section 4.3): an organ in a calm body with a clean service record may give back; an organ in a stressed body may only
add. On Kubernetes the **release gate** (`omnicompass/nervous_system.py`, `node_release_gate`) lets one machine be
given back only when every one of the following holds, and writes the first reason that fails into the audit so a reader
can see why a machine was kept: the remaining machines would stay under 95% full; no pod is waiting for a place; the
pods are not scaling up; the service is not breached; the organ's own pressure is under the release threshold; every
sense is live; and the last command has landed (no new order goes on top of one the cluster has not yet carried out).
One machine per decision is the rule in the slow, reversible direction; past the wall, one machine up at once.

### 7.2 Proprioception and the one-writer rule

The nervous system knows where its own levers are. Every write is read back from the device (the plug contract, section
8), and the audit records both the value sent and the value the device took. If a lever is found at a value Omni-Compass
did not write, someone else owns it: the governor stops writing that lever and leaves it alone, because restoring over it
would fight the new owner. This is **proprioception**: the governor's sense of its own hand. It is the reason a wrong
installation leaves a signature in the receipts (section 8.5) rather than a silent error, and it is what the wire check
proves before anything runs.

### 7.3 Blind means hold, and fail up

A sense that goes stale or unreadable is not read as calm. It is read as **blind**, and while any sense is blind nothing
is given back; the knob holds, or, if the service was breached when the sense went blind, returns to native at once. In
the fault test on real Kubernetes the response-time probe is deliberately paused for a minute in every arm; the audit
shows the governor holding through the blind minute and resuming when the sense returns, and the table shows no row
worse for it. The rule is simple to state and strict in effect: Omni-Compass never acts on a reading it does not have.

### 7.4 Why one brain

The alternative to one brain is a controller per layer, each tuned alone: an autoscaler that adds pods while a power cap
is trying to hold the machines down, a cooling loop that chases heat the clock governor is about to remove. These
controllers fight because none of them knows the others' intent. One law that sets every knob from one state cannot
fight itself: the force on each lever is computed from the same reading of the same body at the same moment. This is also
why the modelled organisms are run whole, at up to 1.7 million muscles on one clock (section 2.4): the question they
answer is whether one brain stays coherent at that size, and the reading at every size is the same to the digit.

## 19. The Nervous System in Detail

### The two-way nervous system (live controller)



**Source.** Manuscript Appendix J: "Nervous system. The signal layer: sensing interfaces, unit integrity, timing
coherence, delay and dropout handling, and feedback interpretation. … The brain cannot compensate for corrupted
signals." Section 5.3: the engine "projects forward state trajectories … and detects destabilization pressure before
divergence."

**The gap.** Before this change, the live controller fed the engine's `stale` (signal dropout) and `drift_ratio`
(actuation mismatch) channels with a constant 0. So the upward path could not report a blind sense, and the downward
path never learned whether its orders landed.

#### Upward: afferent integrity (senses to engine)
**Every declared sense reports whether it is live.**
- **Latency.** Blind when its newest sample is older than two windows by the wall clock, or when the window holds no
  successful request.
  - A hung probe freezes its file; its last clean window must never be read as the present.
  - Failed requests inside a live window become latency pressure (the failed share), so a failure is never read as
    silence.
- **Power.** Blind when its command returns no number.

**How blindness is used.**
- The blind share enters the engine as `stale`. It raises E, lowers U and feeds the external bath (equations 1-3 via
  `assimilate`).
- The nervous system grants no contraction on a blind sense, to any organ, and admits no held batch work.
- Expansion and batch pause (the protective directions) stay allowed.

#### Downward and back: efferent feedback (proprioception)
**Every command is recorded.**
- The node count commanded.
- The HPA targets written.

**At the next decision the observed state is read back.** For each organ, `drift = |observed - commanded| /
commanded`.
- The largest drift enters the engine as `drift_ratio`. It raises E and I_U, lowers U and feeds B (equations 1-3).
- The node organ may not be given a new release while its last command did not land. For example, a drain refused
  by the PodDisruptionBudget leaves the node in service, and the next decision sees it.

#### Sideways: attribution (organ to organ)
**The machine organ has its own engine view**, fed with machine-attributable pressure only (pods waiting for a place).

**It releases a machine only when all of these hold:**
- pods are not scaling up and latency is not breached;
- nothing is pending;
- after the release the remaining machines stay at or below the engine's rho;
- its own calm, stress and security gates grant contraction;
- every sense is live;
- its last command landed.

#### Tests (all in `verify.py`)
| Test | What it checks |
|---|---|
| `tests/test_two_way.py` | blind senses (about 75,000 random states), frozen-probe detection, failures read as pressure, release refused while blind or after an order that did not land |
| `tests/test_node_release_gate.py` | the release gate, over 200,000 states |
| `tests/test_nervous_system.py` | the original invariants N1-N6, over 300,000 states |

Every live decision records the senses, their ages, the proprioceptive drift and the gate's reason in the audit, and
the benchmark prints them in the job log.

# Part Four. The Body: Muscles, Realms and Organisms

*Six hundred and fifty-six muscles in four realms, stacked into six organisms, and every gauge used to judge them.*


## 20. The Muscles, the Realms and the Six Organisms


### 2.1 The catalog

The catalog (`realms/catalog.csv`) lists **945 distinct muscles in 59 families** (Omni v2 and v3; v1 listed 656 in 46),
each with its family, its plant model and its knob. A muscle is anything with a meter and a setting: a compute pool and
its machine count, a GPU and its clock ceiling, a chiller and its setpoint, a battery and its reserve, a feeder and its
tap, a robot joint and its speed limit, a pump and its flow. Each muscle carries a declared plant model, the simplest
physics that reproduces how its meter follows its knob, and a native controller of its own, which is what the muscle does
when Omni-Compass is not there. The catalog was built in four waves (`docs/realm_study/`): the spine from primary
specifications, each realm's extras from its own specifications, a cross-check against industry and open-source
controllers, and a verification, de-duplication and mapping pass. The register (`docs/REGISTER.md`, section 1) lists
every family with its muscle count and the kinds of knob it carries, so a reader can see at a glance what the modelled
realms contain and what they do not.

### 2.2 The four realms and the spine

The muscles fall into four realms. Every realm stands on the same **spine** of 257 muscles (Kubernetes, machines, GPUs
and CPUs, network, storage, observability, security, cooling and electrical distribution), because every realm's work
runs on computers that must be cooled and powered, plus its own domain muscles.

| Organism | Muscles | What it is |
|---|---:|---|
| 1. Compute / AI / Cloud | 430 | clusters, GPUs, AI training and inference, cloud capacity |
| 2. Physics / Robotics / Autonomous | 376 | joints, fleets, vehicles, flight and spacecraft axes |
| 3. Energy / Facility / Industrial | 470 | data halls, buildings, batteries, UPS, process loops, feeders, hospitals, farms, pipelines, mines, district heat, power plants, renewables, pharmaceutical and food plants |
| 4. Distribution / Specialized | 440 | networks, storage, databases, commerce, workflows, radio networks, clinical systems, ports |
| 5. The four stacked, every duplicate kept | 1,716 | all four realms on one clock, the shared spine counted in each |
| 6. The whole tower, every muscle once | 945 | every distinct muscle on one clock |

The realms differ in what their domain muscles are and in how much slack their native controllers leave. Compute, AI and
Cloud is clusters, cards, training and inference pools and cloud capacity, where the knobs are replica targets, machine
counts, clock ceilings and power limits, and where native controllers are already good, so the modelled gains are small
and the real gains come from the queue and the tail. Physics, Robotics and Autonomous is joints, fleets, vehicles, flight
and spacecraft axes, where the knob is a speed or effort limit and the physics decides, axis by axis, whether spending
slack as speed saves energy at all; this is the realm the v3 slack gate was written for. Energy, Facility and Industrial
is data halls, buildings, batteries, UPS, process loops, feeders and plants, where the knobs are setpoints, units in
service, reserves and taps, and where the muscles with the most room are also the ones whose reserves exist for a reason
the model does not contain (a UPS held for an outage is never a lever). Distribution and Specialized is networks, storage,
databases, commerce, workflows, radio networks, clinical systems and ports, where the knob is usually an admission, a
pool or a replica count, and where the real stacks of this manual (the pooler, the broker, the cache) live. Every realm's
list, by family and knob, is `docs/REALM_MUSCLES.md` and `docs/REGISTER.md` section 1.

### 2.3 What an organism run is

These six organisms are the benchmark set of the modelled realms. An organism is every one of its muscles stepped on one
clock, each from its own plant model, each with its own native controller, and the whole fed one demand trace from one
seed. Native runs the organism with every native controller alone. Omni runs the same organism, the same seed, the same
demand and the same clock, with the compass law on every knob the verdict allows. Each run produces its own receipt: the
organism's work, its energy, its time over its service line, and every knob's hand-back. In code and in the workflows the
two large organisms are named `tower` and `stack`, never by a count, because the counts changed between v1 and v2 and a
name that carried a count would read as a different organism; the old names are read as aliases.

### 2.4 The grid of copies and runs

Every organism runs at **1, 10, 100 and 1,000 copies** (that many instances of the organism on one clock, so the four
stacked at 1,000 copies is 1.7 million modelled muscles) and at **1, 10, 100 and 1,000 paired runs** (that many
native-and-omni pairs, each from its own seed): 96 cells in all, both arms shown in every cell. One thousand is the
maximum in both directions. The grid as it stands (`results/scale/GRID.md`) is 84 of 90 judged cells on Omni v3; the six
cells left, 100 and 1,000 runs at 1,000 copies, are beyond the machines available and are declared as such, not hidden.
The reading at every size is the same to the digit, which is itself a finding about the law: it does not drift with scale.

### 2.5 The organisms with a real cluster inside

The modelled organisms are also run with a **real Kubernetes cluster inside** as one more muscle (`tools/run_kil.py`,
workflows `six-kube`, `big-organism`, `big-organism-detached`): the organism's own compute demand drives a real load
generator against a real service on a real cluster, and the cluster's watts come back into the organism as heat and load.
At 1 to 100 copies this runs on GitHub's machines; at 1,000 copies it needs a rented machine and runs there, detached from
the GitHub job that started it, for about seven hours a repetition. These runs are evidence class L for the cluster and S
for the organism around it, and are labelled "L + S".

### 2.6 The register

The register (`docs/REGISTER.md`) is the one list a referee can audit: every muscle by family (section 1), every
benchmark by platform with its native controller, Omni-Compass's knob, its gauges, its result and its file (section 2),
what is not measured yet, said plainly (section 3), and every open benchmark still to run, in order, one or two at a time
(section 4). The program that takes each benchmark to its full size, with what each step costs, is `docs/PROOF_PROGRAM.md`.
Every benchmark in this manual appears in the register under the same name.


## 21. The Four Realms



The muscle tower on modelled plants (945 muscles in Omni v2, 656 in v1): four realms and the whole tower as a fifth organism, each run natively and
with Omni-Compass on top, with meters and receipts. Evidence class **S** (simulation).

### Run it

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 tools/run_realms.py                      # the preregistered run: every muscle and 5 organisms, seeds 1000-1009
python3 tests/test_realms.py                     # the harness's own checks (also inside verify.py)
```

Results (Omni v3; v2's are in `results/realms/v2/`, v1's in `results/realms/v1/`): `results/realms/REALMS.md` (the tables), `MUSCLES.csv` (one row per muscle), `REALMS.json` (every per-seed
contrast), `RUN.json` and `SHA256SUMS.txt` (commit and fingerprints).

### What is where

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `realms/catalog.csv` | the 945 muscles: family, name, realm, plant, parameter set, knob (v1's 656: `realms/catalog_v1.csv`) |
| `tools/realms_catalog.py` | the rules that gave each muscle its realm, plant and knob |
| `realms/plants.py` | the five plants and their native controllers; the four knobs; the capacity law for one plant |
| `realms/presets.py` | every parameter, one set per family class |
| `realms/harness.py` | the arms (native, watch, omni, fixed setpoint), the organisms, the outcome and the label rule |
| `docs/REALMS_PREREGISTRATION.md` | the question, the rules, the seeds and the development history, frozen before the run |

### How it relates to the rest

| Layer | Realm harness | Elsewhere in this repository |
|---|---|---|
| Mathematics (T, V) | uses the frozen engine and governor unchanged | `docs/TRACKING_THEOREM.md`, `verify.py` |
| Simulation (S) | **this** | fleet and cluster simulators, GPU model |
| Real software (L) | not here | set 22 on real Kubernetes (`results/live/LIVE_REPS_22.md`) |
| Physical (P) | not here | the GPU bench: first run on an NVIDIA A10, 2026-10-02 (`results/gpu/run-20261002T082232Z/GPU_REPS.md`); the corrected governor not yet run on a card (`docs/GPU_PREREGISTRATION.md`) |

A realm result that looks good is a reason to test that knob on a real machine, not a substitute for it. The realms
whose knobs can be tested for real first are the compute realm's (the GPU bench, kind), because the tools already
exist.

## 22. The Realm Muscles



Generated from `realms/catalog.csv` (rules: `tools/realms_catalog.py`; the v2 build: `tools/realms_catalog_v2.py`). Every realm's organism is its own families plus the **shared spine** (the infrastructure every real stack runs on), so the realm counts add to more than the tower. Each muscle is followed by the one knob Omni may hold on it.

## 23. The Domain Map



Every system Omni-Compass can sit on, what it reads, what it pushes, the reflexes that bound it, and where it stands.

### 1. The connector pattern

Omni-Compass is the same engine on every muscle. Each muscle gets one connector with five parts:

| Part | Role | Example (compute) |
|---|---|---|
| Afferent (sense) | What the muscle reports | load, pending work, power, heat |
| Engine | Equations (1)-(7) turn readings into state: error E, coherence U, pressure I_U, stress S, bath B | same six-state engine everywhere |
| Efferent (push) | The equation (2) law and allocation law drive the muscle toward convergence | node count, HPA target, power cap |
| Reflex (shield) | Hard limits checked before any push | never below pod requests, step limits, power limit |
| Kill | Control returns to the muscle's own controllers | restore HPA targets, observe only |

Fit tiers used below:
- **Direct**: Omni can govern the muscle as a supervisory controller.
- **Supervisory**: Omni governs budgets, schedules and envelopes; the muscle's own real-time controller stays in charge of fast inner loops.
- **Advisory**: regulated or safety-critical; Omni recommends until certified (IEC 61508, DO-178C, ISO 26262, medical and financial regulation).
- **Not Omni's problem**: a different kind of problem; stated so no one claims otherwise.

Status: **Wired** (in code, verified), **Partial**, **Open** (connector not yet built).

### 2. Digital infrastructure

| Muscle | Reads | Pushes | Reflexes | Fit | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Compute nodes and node pools | load, pending pods, requests | node count, park or power off | request floor, step limit | Direct | **Wired** |
| Pods via HPA | utilisation, replicas | HPA target | bounds 50-95% | Direct | **Wired** |
| Power caps | watts, site limit | per-node caps | site power limit (I4) | Direct | **Wired** (harness) |
| Heat | temperatures | feeds decisions | thermal limit | Direct | **Sensed** |

| Observability pipelines | data volume, cost | sampling, retention | required audit data | Direct | Open |
| Security posture | policy blocks | block expansion during holds | I1 | Direct | Partial (sensed) |

### 3. AI

| Muscle | Reads | Pushes | Reflexes | Fit | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Training clusters | GPU power, progress, network | power caps, packing, checkpoint timing | never kill a run mid-step | Direct | Open (gpu vessels in harness) |
| Training power smoothing | synchronised power swings | ramp limits, staggering | grid ramp limits | Direct | Open |
| Inference serving | request rate, latency, queue, GPU memory | replicas, batch size, GPU sharing | latency SLO | Direct | Open |
| Model routing and cost | cost per request, quality signals | route to smaller or larger models, token budgets | quality floor | Direct | Open |
| Model releases | evaluation results, drift, errors | gate, pause, roll back a model | release gates | Direct | Open |
| Data pipelines, vector databases | backlog, freshness | scaling, scheduling | freshness bounds | Direct | Open |
| AI agents: containment | actions, spend, resources, network use | CPU, memory, network and spend caps, tool permissions | hard caps, instant kill | Direct | Open |
| Carbon-aware AI | grid price and carbon intensity | when and where training runs | deadlines | Direct | Open |

#### AI alignment: what Omni can and cannot do

Alignment has two parts, and only one is Omni's.

| Part | What it means | Omni's role |
|---|---|---|
| **Value alignment** | The model itself wants and does what people intend: honest, safe, helpful behaviour learned in training | **Not Omni's problem.** A governor outside the model cannot make the model's goals or judgement correct. |
| **Control and containment** | Whatever the model wants, it can only act within bounds: resources, permissions, spend, network reach, a kill that works | **Direct.** This is a governance problem: sense what the agent is doing, bound what it may spend and touch, revoke instantly, keep an audit trail. |

Omni-Compass can be the boundary layer AI runs inside. It cannot be the thing that makes AI trustworthy. Claims must keep that line.

|---|---|---|---|
| HPC / supercomputers | job queues, power, cooling | none beyond the facility | Direct |
| Quantum-computer facilities | cryogenics energy, calibration scheduling | qubit control | Supervisory |

### 8. Order of wiring

1. Digital infrastructure: GPUs, CPU power states, memory, storage, network, job queues, multi-region.
2. Facilities and energy: cooling plant, power distribution, batteries, demand response.
3. AI: training power smoothing, inference serving, model routing, agent containment.
4. Physical operations, then science and space as supervisors.
5. Regulated domains as advisors, until certified.

Each connector follows the same path as compute: wired, benchmarked against today's controls, verified, pre-registered, tested on held-out scenarios, then released.

## 24. The Problem Map



Method: the issue trackers of the projects that run the world's clusters (Kubernetes autoscaler, Karpenter, Kepler,
Kueue, Volcano, Knative, KEDA, kubernetes/kubernetes), the public industry reports (Cast AI, Datadog, Uptime Institute,
IEA) and recent papers (Meta Llama 3, AI-datacenter power stabilisation). Not all of GitHub: a targeted scan of where
the money and the failures are. Status: **have** = in this repository and tested; **partial** = built but not proven
live; **missing** = not built.

| # | Problem (evidence) | Size | Best tool today and its gap | Omni-Compass fit | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Idle capacity.** Average Kubernetes CPU utilisation 8%, memory 20%, falling; CPU over-provisioning 69%, memory 79% (Cast AI 2026). 83% of container cost goes to idle resources (Datadog) | largest money leak in cloud | Karpenter, Cluster Autoscaler, CAST AI: each fixes nodes only | one authority over replicas, requests, nodes and power | **built** (omnilab/rightsize.py, held-out) |
| 2 | **HPA and VPA cannot be used together on CPU/memory**, "not compatible by design" (kubernetes/autoscaler #1726, #2939, #6060, #6247; coordination asked again in #8493, 2025) | blocks right-sizing for most teams | none; official advice is "don't" | exactly what a single authority solves: one engine owns both numerator and denominator | **built** (omnilab/rightsize.py: HPA+VPA vs one authority, held-out) |
| 3 | **Karpenter consolidation churn**: nodes replaced every 5-10 minutes for 2-3 generations, busy nodes removed instead of empty ones, one shared timer (karpenter #1851, #1019, #2705, #3046; provider-aws #7146, #8868, #7356, #8536) | outages, wasted boots | Karpenter's own timers and budgets | engine-gated release (equation 2) plus dwell; C-throughput cut node churn 50% in simulation | built in simulation (AKS NAP = Karpenter arm, tuning/vendor_compare.py); live Karpenter opponent next |
| 4 | **CPU limits throttle apps** (CFS quota), causing latency and even OOMs (kubernetes/kubernetes #67577, #97445) | latency tails | manual tuning, "remove limits" advice | power-cap muscle must watch latency; our first live run hit this exact problem | have; live runs 3-5 found and fixed the resize permission |
| 5 | **Cold starts / scale-from-zero latency** (knative/serving #4902, #14202, #9104; kedacore/http-add-on #219) | seconds of latency per edge | Knative activator, KEDA | pre-warming decided by the engine from its state (anticipation) | **built** (omnilab/coldstart.py, held-out) |
| 6 | **GPU utilisation ~5%** (Cast AI 2026); idle GPUs scattered across nodes (volcano #3948, kueue #5243) | the most expensive silicon idle | KAI Scheduler, HAMi, nvshare, Volcano binpack | GPU power-limit muscle (have, calibrated), packing and sharing (missing) | **built** (omnilab/gpupack.py, held-out) + power limit |
| 7 | **AI training power swings**: 50-75% of TDP in milliseconds per GPU, ramps over 1000 MW/s at gigawatt scale; operators impose power and ramp-rate limits (SemiAnalysis; Uptime; arXiv 2508.14318, 2606.04869) | grid-connection risk, equipment damage | batteries, fast PSUs, manual GPU power caps | "training power smoothing" muscle: ramp-rate limit through GPU power caps, the engine's bath state B is literally a damped oscillator | **built** (omnilab/powersmooth.py, held-out; basin-only arm recorded) |
| 8 | **GPU failures and stragglers**: Llama 3, 419 interruptions in 54 days on 16K H100s, one every ~3 hours; 58.7% GPU-related; slow stragglers undetected (Meta; Lablup 2605.09370) | lost training time | Meta's internal tools, checkpointing | hardware-health muscle: sense straggling, drain early | **built** (omnilab/health.py, held-out) |
| 9 | **Outages**: 54% cost more than $100,000, 1 in 5 more than $1M; power causes 45% of incidents (Uptime 2025) | direct money | SRE runbooks, AIOps | recovery and physical-SLA results in simulation: recovery 58 to 17 min | have (sim) |
| 10 | **Cooling**: industry PUE stuck at ~1.54 for six years (Uptime 2025) | ~35% overhead on every watt | DCIM, DeepMind cooling AI | heat afferent have; cooling-plant muscle | **built** (omnilab/cooling.py, held-out) |
| 11 | **Energy measurement in VMs is impossible**: no RAPL/IPMI in VMs, Kepler building a model server (kepler #2487, 2026) | nobody can prove savings in cloud VMs | Kepler estimators | same gap we hit | **built** (omnilab/vmenergy.py: meter-calibrated attribution, held-out) |
| 12 | **LLM inference autoscaling**: KV cache fills memory before compute; prefill vs decode need separate scaling (vLLM, llm-d) | latency and GPU cost | llm-d, KServe, custom | inference muscle: scale on KV-cache use and queue, not CPU | **built** (omnilab/inference.py, held-out) |
| 13 | **Runaway AI agents**: loops and recursive calls, ~$10,000 overnight examples (Dark Reading; sandbox guides) | cost and safety | per-tool caps, early kill-switch projects | agent-containment muscle: caps, kill, audit | **built** (omnilab/containment.py, held-out); live version next |
| 14 | **Human error**: failures to follow procedures rose 10 points (Uptime 2025) | outages | runbooks | fewer manual actions: pages and human interventions to zero in simulation | have (sim) |

### Results of the build pass (held-out seeds 90001-90030, 30 per muscle, code frozen by SHA first)

Omni-Compass against the strongest native tool in each muscle; + better, - worse, = tie / not significant.

| # | Muscle | Opponent (best native) | Better | Worse | Tie / n.s. |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1-2 | right-sizing | VPA in-place + HPA | CPU -3%, memory -11%, p99 -99%, reversals -84%, SLO minutes -57% | p95 +15%, OOM kills (few) | work done |
| 5 | cold start | KEDA HTTP | p95 -75%, p99 -58%, delayed >1 s -71%, instance-hours -8% | cold-start count (x8) | |
| 6 | GPU packing | Volcano binpack | idle powered GPU-hours -20%, energy -2% | mean wait +16% (seconds) | p95 wait, jobs, fragmentation |
| 7 | training power | vendor floor, worst-day setting | burn -9%, throughput loss -44%, 1-s swing -6% | max ramp (inside the grid's limit) | 0 grid violations both |
| 8 | GPU health | threshold detection | goodput +10%, lost GPU-h -20%, restarts -29%, straggler hours -99% | | checkpoint overhead |
| 10 | cooling | outdoor-air reset | PUE -2%, cooling -13%, inlet violations -73% | | max inlet |
| 11 | VM energy | host meter split by CPU | per-VM error -37%, worst VM -34% | | total |
| 12 | LLM inference | KEDA on queue | TTFT p95 -18%, SLO breaches -58%, GPU-hours -19%, preemptions -56% | | TPOT, TTFT p50 |
| 13 | agent containment | static caps | rogue spend -96%, time to contain -99%, peak sub-agents -59% | false stops (0.6 -> ~2.7/day), honest work -7% | forbidden actions (0 both: RBAC) |

Engine vs no-engine: in every muscle the omni_no_engine arm scores close to omni. The mapping from engine state to
action carries most of the effect; the evolved dynamics add smoothing. The basin-only arm (power smoothing, the bath
equation alone setting the draw) cut ramps 63% but did not hold the grid limit: the human-set limit is required.

### What this says

- The problems with the most money behind them are **idle capacity (1)**, **HPA/VPA coordination (2)** and **GPU
  idleness (6)**. Problem 2 is the cleanest proof of Omni-Compass's thesis: the Kubernetes project itself says its two
  autoscalers cannot share a metric, because they fight. A single engine owning both is the answer the issue tracker
  keeps asking for.
- The problem with the most strategic weight is **AI training power swings (7)**: it is new, it threatens grid
  connections, and Omni-Compass's own equation (7) is a damped second-order bath, the natural controller for ramp limits.
- The problems we already hit ourselves (4, 11) are the same ones the industry has: good evidence the benchmark is real.

### Build order proposed

1. Request right-sizing muscle (VPA role) under the same engine, benchmarked against HPA + VPA "in conflict".
2. Training power-smoothing muscle (GPU power-cap ramp limits) with a synthetic synchronized-training power trace.
3. GPU packing / fragmentation muscle (with fake-gpu-operator or KWOK on the live cluster).
4. Live Karpenter opponent (kwok provider) to test problem 3 head to head.
5. Inference muscle (KV-cache and queue driven), then hardware-health (straggler drain), then agent containment.

## 25. The Six Organisms and the Benchmark Grid


Omni-Compass is benchmarked on six organisms, each run native and with Omni-Compass on top on the same seed, the same
load and the same clock: Compute / AI / Cloud (430 muscles), Physics / Robotics / Autonomous (376), Energy / Facility /
Industrial (470), Distribution / Specialized (440), the four stacked with every duplicate kept (1,716), and the whole
tower with every muscle once (945); these are the Omni v2 counts, v1's were 345, 262, 282, 337, 1,226 and 656.

Each organism is run at 1, 10, 100 and 1,000 paired runs and at 1, 10, 100 and 1,000 copies of the organism on one
clock. Every receipt shows work per energy, work, energy, the time spent outside the service line, and whether every
knob was handed back.

**What the grid has shown.** On Omni v3, 84 of the 90 judged cells are done (`results/scale/GRID.md`): every organism
reads superior within its guardrails in every cell of ten runs or more, with work per energy +0.07% (the Physics realm) to
+0.37% (the Energy realm, the four stacked and the tower), the work unchanged, the time over the line not above native's,
and every knob handed back. The figure is the same at every size, from one copy to a thousand, which is the property the
grid exists to test: one brain stays coherent at 1.7 million muscles. The six cells left, 100 and 1,000 runs at 1,000
copies, are beyond the machines available and are declared, not hidden. The number is small because the native controllers
in the models are well tuned and leave little room; it is real within the model, and it is never counted in the Omni
index, which is made of real stacks only.

On a GPU machine the real card is wired into each organism as one more muscle of its NVIDIA GPU family; its own power
meter and its requests are counted in the organism's receipt, kept apart from the modelled plants and also added to
them. Real Kubernetes is benchmarked separately on real clusters, and it is also wired into the organisms as one more
muscle (`tools/run_kil.py`): at 1 to 100 copies on GitHub's machines and at 1,000 copies on a rented machine, the
organism's own compute demand drives a real load generator against a real service on a real cluster, and the cluster's
watts come back into the organism as heat and load. Those runs are labelled "L + S": the cluster is live software, the
organism around it a model.

The six organisms are models (evidence class S). They show how the law behaves across hundreds of kinds of machine at
once and whether its effect is stable as the count and the size grow. Real Kubernetes, the real database, the real broker,
the real cache and the real card are the anchors measured on real software and, for the card, a real meter; their results
and their losses are in the manual's section 16.


## 26. The Metrics Catalog



Every gauge Omni-Compass produces, where it comes from, and what kind of number it is. Three kinds:

- **Measured**: read from a real system (a real Kubernetes cluster, a real GPU's own meter, a real wall plug).
- **Modelled**: computed by a simulation from declared physics or recorded traces. It shows the mechanism, not a
  measurement.
- **Internal**: Omni-Compass's own state and decisions, recorded in its audit log on every decision, live or simulated.

Every report says which kind each number is. A modelled number is never presented as a measured one.

---

### 1. Service: what the customer feels

| Gauge | Unit | Where | Kind |
|---|---|---|---|
| Response time, mean / 95th / 99th percentile | ms | live Kubernetes (`tools/live_reps.py`), GPU bench (`tools/gpu_reps.py`), GPU sims | measured live; modelled in sims |
| Failed requests | % | live Kubernetes | measured |
| Requests served / not served | count | GPU bench, GPU sims | measured / modelled |
| Pod start wait, total and mean | s | live Kubernetes (API server creation-to-Ready) | measured |
| Pending pods | pod-minutes | live Kubernetes | measured |
| Backlog (SLO breach) minutes | min | site and node exchange sims, stack benchmark | modelled |
| 95th-percentile latency factor | × | site and node exchange sims | modelled |
| Availability, time healthy, recovery minutes, recovered | share, min | stack benchmark (`benchmarks/stack_benchmark.py`) | modelled |
| SLA violations (physical, total, backlog, power, heat) | share of time | stack benchmark | modelled |

### 2. Work and capacity: what the operator gets for the money

| Gauge | Unit | Where | Kind |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Work per energy** (served requests per kJ) | req/kJ | GPU bench (the preregistered primary outcome), GPU sims | measured / modelled |
| Work per wall energy (whole machine) | req/kJ | GPU bench with a smart plug (`tools/wall_meter.py`) | measured |
| Work served | work units | site and node exchange sims | modelled |
| Work per kWh | units/kWh | node exchange sim | modelled |
| Energy per served request | J | GPU bench | measured |
| Energy per core-hour | Wh | live Kubernetes | declared model |
| CPU used by the app | cores | live Kubernetes (`kubectl top`) | measured |
| Utilisation (used / allocatable) | share | live Kubernetes | measured |
| Replicas (HPA), mean | count | live Kubernetes | measured |
| Pods started | count | live Kubernetes | measured |
| Worker nodes in service, node-hours, idle node-hours | count, h | live Kubernetes, stack benchmark | measured / modelled |

### 3. Energy and power: the bill and the building

| Gauge | Unit | Where | Kind |
|---|---|---|---|
| GPU energy (the device's own `power.draw`, integrated) | J | GPU bench | measured |
| GPU mean power | W | GPU bench, GPU sims | measured / modelled |
| CPU package energy (RAPL) | J | GPU bench, where the machine exposes RAPL | measured |
| Whole-machine energy at the wall | J | GPU bench with a smart plug | measured |
| Energy on kind | Wh | live Kubernetes | **declared model** (kind has no meter) |
| Energy | kWh | site, node exchange and stack sims | modelled |
| Peak power | kW | site and node exchange sims, stack benchmark | modelled |
| **Site-budget violation minutes** (time over the building's limit) | min | site and node exchange sims | modelled |
| GPU power limit, mean; power-limit writes | W, count | GPU bench, GPU sims | measured / modelled |
| Power-cap travel | share | stack benchmark | modelled |

### 4. Hardware: heat and wear

| Gauge | Unit | Where | Kind |
|---|---|---|---|
| GPU temperature, peak and mean | °C | GPU bench, GPU sims | measured / modelled |
| Heat-over minutes | min | hardware plant sim (`hardware/plant.py`) | modelled |
| Thermal travel | share | stack benchmark | modelled |
| Machine round trips, node starts and stops, scale reversals | count | stack benchmark | modelled |

Lower power and fewer temperature swings are the conditions for longer hardware life. **No hardware life extension is
claimed** until real temperature, duty-cycle and wear records exist.

### 5. Battery equivalent (derived)

A battery holds a fixed amount of energy, so battery life follows directly from work per energy:

- runtime on the same charge, for the same work: × (native energy ÷ Omni-Compass energy)
- work on the same charge: × (Omni-Compass work per energy ÷ native work per energy)

Example: the modelled GPU card at +5.1% work per kJ (`results/gpu/sim/after`) does 5.1% more work on one charge.
The same rule turns any measured work-per-energy result into a battery figure. On-site battery banks as an organ of
the power budget are designed (`docs/DOMAIN_MAP.md`, "on-site batteries") and not yet built.

### 6. Safety and control: proof it behaved

| Gauge | Where | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| Writes executed per arm (native 0, watch 0, Omni-Compass n) | GPU bench, live Kubernetes | measured |
| Every arm ended at its start setting (the reset restored it) | GPU bench, live Kubernetes switch drill | measured |
| Invariant violations (all, and excluding power) | stack benchmark | modelled |
| Security violations, contradictions, pages | stack benchmark | modelled |
| Freeze check: code hashes at start and end (confirmation runs) | GPU bench (`FREEZE.json`, `FREEZE_END.json`) | measured |
| SHA-256 of every raw file | every live run | measured |
| The seal: every Python/C++ twin unchanged since proven equal | `results/SEAL.json`, `verify.py` | checked on every build |

### 7. Internal: Omni-Compass's own state, on every decision (audit log)

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `E, U, I_U, S, B, B_dot` | the six-state engine: energy, coherence (health), unmet-need integral, stress, redistribution, its rate |
| `state_observed`, `state_projected_next`, `prediction_error` | what the device said, what the engine projected, and how far off the last projection was |
| `requested_cap`, `granted_cap`, `shield_bound`, `want_w` | what the engine asked for, what the shield allowed, which bound decided it, the limit written |
| `admissible` | whether the engine was permitted to change anything this decision |
| `speed_lock` (`ratios`, `line`, `aim`, `rate`) | the speed lock's reading against the run without Omni-Compass |
| `convey` engaged / released | when idle CPU is conveyed to serving pods, and when it is given back |
| `authority`: `calm` and its scalars (`kappa, h, sigma, nu`), `execute`, `contract` per organ, and the machine organ's own view | how settled the engine is, whether it may act at all, and which organs may give capacity back this decision (Kubernetes controller; `omnicompass/nervous_system.py`) |
| compass readings | the direction the engine reads the whole system to be moving (`omnicompass/compass.py`) |
| `write`, `would_write`, `why` | every command sent (or, in watch mode, withheld) and its reason |
| `snapshot`, `restored` | every setting read at start, and its read-back after the reset |

### 8. Where each report lives

# Part Five. The Harness and the Wiring

*The universal plug, the adapters, the wire check, and the step-by-step work of wiring Omni-Compass onto a running stack.*


## 27. The Plug, the Adapters and the Wire Check


Think of a high-end car stereo: one head unit, one standard plug on its back, and an adapter harness for each make of
car that matches the car's factory plug. You never cut a factory wire, and when you pull the stereo, the car works as
it did. Omni-Compass is wired the same way.

**8.1 The plug (one design for every muscle).** Each plug has as many channels as its muscle has knobs. Every channel
declares its cover (range), its direction (which way is "more"), its units and how fast it may move. Every plug keeps
the same contract (`omnicompass/compass_law.py`, `Plug`):

1. **attach** - read the knob once, before any write: the snapshot. It never moves afterwards.
2. **read** - the service reading, into the compass.
3. **write** - one value, clipped to the cover, then read back from the device.
4. **one writer** - if the knob is found at a value Omni-Compass did not write, someone else owns it: Omni-Compass
   stops writing and leaves that value alone.
5. **restore** - on stop, the knob returns to the snapshot (where Omni-Compass found it, not the last value it wrote).
   For muscles whose native controller moves the knob itself, restore hands control back.

**8.2 Adapters (one per standard plug).** Omni-Compass speaks each industry's standard control interface through an
adapter. Status is stated plainly:

| Standard | Muscles | Adapter status |
|---|---|---|
| Kubernetes API | HPAs, deployments, pods, nodes | **built** (`omni_controller/controller.py`, `muscles.py`) |
| NVIDIA NVML / `nvidia-smi` | GPU clock ceiling, power limit | **built** (`omni_controller/gpu_compass.py`, two wires; `gpu_governor.py`, one wire) |
| Linux cpufreq, RAPL | CPU frequency ceiling, package watts | **built** (`--cpufreq-policy-root`, `--rapl-cmd`) |
| Site meter, building controller by command | site watts, supply-air setpoint | **built** (`--power-cmd`, `--cooling-cmd` command templates) |
| Cloud node groups (Karpenter, Cluster Autoscaler, MachineSet) | machines | **built** through `--node-scale-cmd` templates |
| BACnet, Modbus, SNMP | chillers, air handlers, PDUs, UPS | designed; today reached through the command templates above |
| OPC UA, EtherNet/IP, PROFINET, EtherCAT, ROS 2, CAN | PLCs, drives, robots, vehicles | designed; modelled in the realm harness |
| IEC 61850, DNP3, OpenADR, IEEE 2030.5, SunSpec, OCPP | substations, batteries, inverters, chargers | designed; modelled in the realm harness |

The engineer's job for one muscle is three things: which adapter, the address of the knob, and its safe range.

**The plug contract, line by line, and why each line is there.** *Attach* reads the knob once before any write and keeps
that value as the snapshot. It is read once and never again, because a snapshot that moved with the knob would restore to
wherever the governor last left it, and the whole point of the restore is to return to where the operator had it. *Read*
takes the service reading (a response time, a temperature, a queue, an error) into the compass as a position in its band;
the plug declares the band, the law does not guess it. *Write* takes one value, clips it to the cover before it leaves the
plug, sends it through the muscle's own interface, and then reads the lever back from the device and records both the
sent and the taken value; a device that took something other than what was sent (a clock that rounds to 15 MHz steps, a
pool size the pooler capped) is recorded as it is, not as it was asked. *One writer* compares the lever as found at every
read with the value last written; a lever found elsewhere has another owner, and the plug raises `ForeignWriter`, after
which the governor leaves that lever alone for the rest of the run and says so in its audit and its exit code. *Restore*
writes the snapshot back on stop and reads it back; a restore that does not read back is an error (exit 3), never a
silent success. The same five lines are implemented for Kubernetes objects (annotations hold the snapshot on the object
itself, so a watchdog can restore from the object without the governor's memory), for `nvidia-smi`, for PgBouncer's
console, for Redis's `CONFIG SET`, for the consumer group and for the simulators' knobs, and `tests/test_*` prove each
against a fake device.

**8.3 Power-up order.** Read-only first; then take the knobs, the least consequential first; on stop, hand them back
in reverse order. In the Kubernetes controller the order is: the latency feed and the cluster's own metrics (read); the
HPA target (a setting the HPA accepts and corrects within a minute); the pods' CPU limits (conveyance, in place); the
machines (the slowest and most consequential, through the release gate and the verdict). On stop the machines are woken
first, then the limits, then the target, so the cluster is never left with fewer machines than its pods need while a
setting above them is still being handed back.

**8.4 The wire check (mandatory before any write).** For the GPU it is one command,
`sudo python3 tools/gpu_wire_check.py --gpu 0`, and `scripts/gpu_rented_run.sh` runs it first and stops if it fails:

| Step | It proves |
|---|---|
| 1 read | every meter answers: watts, temperature, utilization, limit, clock, top clock |
| 2 snapshot | the start limit is recorded once |
| 3 up wire | with the card busy, a ceiling below its own busy clock pulls the clock down under it; reset, the clock comes back above it |
| 4 down wire | a lower power limit is reported back exactly; the start limit is reported back exactly |
| 5 restore | clocks reset and the start limit read back |
| 6 stop | the governor, stopped by its signal, hands both wires back |
| 7 other writer | a limit set by someone else while the governor runs is left alone, and the governor exits 5 |

Any failure prints the wire, the step and what the device said, and nothing else runs. That turns a wiring fault from
guesswork into one named line to fix.

**8.5 Wired right or wired wrong.** The wire check proves the wires move. It does not prove the governor reads the
right thing. A correct installation leaves signatures in its own receipts; a wrong one leaves others. Check them on
your first paired runs, before you believe any number, good or bad.

| Check | Wired right | Wired wrong, and what to look at |
|---|---|---|
| Watch arm against native | equal on every gauge (watch writes nothing) | different: the probe, the load or the machine differs between arms, not Omni |
| Requests served, failed requests | equal to native | fewer served or more failed: a lever is cutting capacity; check its cover and its sign |
| p95 and p99 response time | at native or faster | slower: the reading or the floors are wrong (rows below) |
| GPU: the card's clock while busy | at or above the clock the card reaches on its own | below it: the speed floor is missing or the lid is under the card's own draw |
| GPU: the lid while busy | at or above the card's own busy draw | at the envelope floor while busy: the lid is sized from a curve, not from the card's own meter |
| GPU: credit per write (`GPU_REPS.md`) | compass decisions pace the slack, race decisions cover the bursts; fail-up is rare | fail-up in most decisions: being busy is being read as a breach, or the service line is set too low |
| Kubernetes: machines given back | through the release gate, one per decision, with no pod waiting | machines given back while pods wait, or none at all while the service is far inside its band: check the latency feed, `--slo-ms` and the release gate's reasons in the audit |
| Kubernetes: the reset | every HPA target, replica range, CPU limit and worker back to native, no record left | anything left: an earlier run or another controller wrote the same objects |
| Every lever after the run | at its snapshot | not at its snapshot: another writer, or a restore that failed (exit 3): restore by hand and investigate |
| The feed itself | fresh samples every few seconds | stale or empty: Omni reads it as blind and fails up; fix the feed, not the governor |

**The rule.** If any row reads "wired wrong", the result of that run says nothing about Omni-Compass: fix the wiring,
run the wire check and the watch arm again, and only then compare. The first real card run is the worked example: its
receipts showed the card's busy clock under its own (736-768 MHz against 861-889), the lid at the 105 W floor under its
own 135 W draw, and fail-up in 46% of decisions. Each of those is a row in this table.

**8.6 The wire check on the other stacks.** The GPU has a one-command wire check because its wires are the hardest to
get right. The other stacks carry the same proof in a different place: every Kubernetes arm records `kubectl auth can-i`
receipts for what the governor's identity can and cannot do (and fails if it can do anything it must not), checks that
the cluster holds nothing but the harness, and ends with the reset check that every HPA target, replica range, CPU limit
and worker is back at native with no record left; every database, broker and cache arm reads the knob back after every
write and hands it back at the end, and the report says "handed back: yes" or the run is invalid; every simulator arm
checks that every override was handed back. The watching arm, where it is run, is the wire check of the reading: a
watching governor that disagrees with native on any gauge has found a difference in the probe, the load or the machine,
not in Omni-Compass.

## 28. The Harness



> **Before you wire anything:** read [`DISCLOSURES.md`](../DISCLOSURES.md). Omni-Compass acts only through the wires it is given; it cannot be slapped on. If your paired receipts differ from the published benchmarks in direction, the first presumption is wiring: confirm the installation with section 8.5 of the manual (*Wired right or wired wrong*).

This tree is the GitHub-ready kit: frozen engine + C++ twin + two plants + live stub.

### What to run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python verify.py --quick          # engine, C++, soak, parity
python k8s_controlplane/test_controlplane.py
python -m k8s_controlplane.suite  # elastic / always_on / idle_power
python tests/test_hpa_three_way.py
python tests/test_omni_controller.py
```

Fleet plant (Omni as node authority vs HPA+CA / Karpenter-lite):

```bash
python -m fleet.planetlab --dir fleet/traces/planetlab --scenarios 8 --out /tmp/pl
```

C++:

```bash
cmake -S cpp -B cpp/build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release && cmake --build cpp/build -j2
./cpp/build/oc_smoke
```

### Two plants (do not mix the tables)

| Tree | What Omni is | What the energy number means |
|---|---|---|
| `k8s_controlplane/` | On top of HPA+CA (target / gate / park) | Pack and optional CA gate on a 20-node replica |
| `fleet/` | Node-pool authority; CA off | Consolidation vs CA and Karpenter-lite |

Observe must match the native arm on that plant. If it does not, the run is invalid.

### Engine species

Shipped `omnicompass/core.py` is the patent principal form: cubic \(U(1-U^2)\), FIG. 4 command, RK4 with held \(u\).
`omnicompass/pools.py` is actuation only (off / hold / park). It does not change the field.

### Not in this harness

Live kube-controller-manager, kind CI, GPU MIG scheduler, facility cooling plant.
`omni_controller/` is observe-first against kubectl; tests use `tests/fake_cluster/kubectl`.

See `LIMITS.md`.

## 29. The Wiring Guide



> **Before you wire anything:** read [`DISCLOSURES.md`](../DISCLOSURES.md). Omni-Compass acts only through the wires it is given; it cannot be slapped on. If your paired receipts differ from the published benchmarks in direction, the first presumption is wiring: confirm the installation with section 8.5 of the manual (*Wired right or wired wrong*).

> **The current manual is `docs/INTEGRATION_MANUAL.md`** (every stack, every level, every switch). This page is kept for
> reference; where the two differ, the integration manual is current.

> The full step-by-step manual, with the switch, the living band, parking and the pod reflex, is
> `docs/OPERATOR_MANUAL.md`. This page is the short version.

**Three stages.** Each stage adds only the permissions it needs. A stage is promoted only after its evidence is in,
and the reset works at every stage:

```
kubectl -n omni-compass exec deploy/omni-compass -- touch /tmp/omni.kill
```

The switch is one human-operated switch for the whole harness (OFF restores every HPA target, replica range, CPU
limit and cordon Omni-Compass changed, and records it; removing the file turns Omni-Compass back ON). It never fires by
itself and never switches off one module: a failed decision is skipped, boundaries are held by the living band.

### 0. Build the image

- The frozen closure-law setting (`/app/law/closure.json`).

**How it runs.** As a non-root user, with a read-only root filesystem and no Linux capabilities.

### 1. Shadow: read-only, decides and logs, never writes
```
kubectl apply -f deploy/install/omni-compass.yaml      # set the image line first
kubectl -n omni-compass logs deploy/omni-compass -f
```
**Proof of read-only.** `scripts/pilot_shadow.sh` runs the same stage from a workstation with `kubectl auth can-i`
receipts that the identity cannot write, and writes `SHADOW_REPORT.md`.

**Run length.** One to two weeks.

**Pass condition.** Zero writes, and recommendations you agree with.

### 2. Target: Omni-Compass sets each HPA's CPU target
```
kubectl apply -f deploy/rbac-target.yaml               # adds: patch horizontalpodautoscalers
kubectl -n omni-compass patch deploy omni-compass --type=json -p \
  '[{"op":"replace","path":"/spec/template/spec/containers/0/args/1","value":"target"}]'
```
**What happens.** The HPAs keep scaling pods. Omni-Compass only moves their target within bounds.

**The SLO reflex.** Add `--latency-file` and `--slo-ms`, and the target is never tighter than native while the SLO is
breached.

**Pass condition.** Latency no worse than native, and fewer pod-hours.

### 3. Node pool: Omni-Compass sizes the node pool
**Add permissions.** `patch nodes`, `create pods/eviction` (`deploy/kind/rbac-omni.yaml` is the tested example).

**Set the mode.** `--mode nodepool --node-scale-cmd "<your pool resize command with {n}>"`. Examples of the resize
command:
- a Karpenter NodePool limit;
- a cloud node-group size;
- `scripts/kind_nodepool.sh` on kind.

**What guards a release.** The machine organ gives a node back only when all of these hold:
- every sense is live;
- its last order landed;
- pods are not scaling up;
- nothing is pending;
- the remaining nodes stay at or below the engine's target utilisation.

A PodDisruptionBudget on each service is required, because drains go through the eviction API.

**Optional levers.** Each has its own flag and permissions, and all are listed in `omni_controller/muscles.py`:
- right-sizing;
- cold start;
- batch pacing;
- agent containment;
- cooling;
- CPU frequency.

## 30. Before You Start, and the Eight Levels


### 9.1 What your system needs

| You run | You need |
|---|---|
| Kubernetes (vanilla, EKS, GKE, AKS, OpenShift/OKD, Rancher, kind) | Kubernetes 1.34 or newer (in-place pod resize); metrics-server (`kubectl top nodes` works); an HPA with a CPU target on each governed service; a readiness probe and a short preStop pause on each service |
| A response-time feed (strongly recommended at every level) | a CSV per service, `elapsed_seconds,latency_ms,ok`, written continuously; `scripts/latency_probe.py` writes one against any HTTP endpoint |
| NVIDIA GPUs | a driver with `nvidia-smi`; root (or the capability to run `nvidia-smi -pl` and `-lgc`); on a VM, full GPU passthrough |
| CPU power control | Linux cpufreq with the schedutil governor; RAPL for package watts; usually bare metal |
| Site power and cooling | a command that prints site watts, and a command that sets the supply-air setpoint through your building management system |

**Why each requirement is there.** Kubernetes 1.34 or newer is required because the conveyance muscle resizes a pod's CPU
limit in place, which older versions do only by restarting the pod, and a restart is a disruption Omni-Compass never
causes. metrics-server is the HPA's own eyes and the governor's: without it neither knows what the pods use. An HPA with a
CPU target on each governed service is the native controller Omni-Compass sits on; a service without one has nothing for
level 2 to move. A readiness probe and a short preStop pause are what make a drain invisible to clients: the Service
stops sending requests to a pod before it stops, and kube-proxy sends them to another ready endpoint. The response-time
feed is the one wire a cluster does not already have: Kubernetes knows what its pods use, not what its users wait; the
compass needs the second, and `scripts/latency_probe.py` writes it against any HTTP endpoint every five seconds. On the
GPU, root is needed only for the two `nvidia-smi` writes, and a VM must pass the whole card through or the driver refuses
to lock clocks (the wire check's step 3 is where that shows).

### 9.2 Get the software and check it

```
git clone https://github.com/The-Omni-Compass-LLC/The-Omni-Compass.git
cd The-Omni-Compass
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 verify.py                       # every check; ends with VERIFICATION: PASS
```

Build the container image once:

```
docker build -f deploy/Dockerfile -t <your-registry>/omni-compass:<tag> .
docker push <your-registry>/omni-compass:<tag>
```

It runs as non-root, with a read-only root filesystem and no Linux capabilities.

### 9.3 The levels

Take them in order. Each has a pass condition; go to the next level only when it holds. The OFF switch works at every
level.

The levels exist because a governor earns authority the way a new operator does: by watching first, then by touching
the setting that is cheapest to undo, then the next. Level 0 touches nothing and proves the software is the software
(`verify.py` checks every sealed file's fingerprint and runs every test). Level 1 watches a live cluster for as long as
the operator likes and logs every decision it would have taken, so the operators can read those decisions against what
they would have done; nothing passes level 1 until they agree with its readings. Level 2 moves the HPA target, which the
HPA itself corrects within a minute if the governor is wrong, and raises replica floors ahead of bursts; it is the first
level that can show a gain and the first that can show a loss, and the paired receipts of section 13 are its pass
condition. Level 3 moves machines, the slowest lever, through the release gate and the verdict; it is where the bill moves
and where the most care is spent. Level 4 hands Omni-Compass the replica decision itself, with the HPA kept as the fast
reflex upward; it is an option, not a step on the way, and the benchmarks in this manual do not use it. Levels 5 to 7 are
the GPU, the CPU and the site, each with its own wire check and its own pass. An installation may stop at any level and
run there indefinitely; most will stop at level 3.

**Level 0 - Evaluate without touching anything.**

```
python3 verify.py
python3 tools/run_scale.py --runs 10 --scale 1 --out results/scale/eval     # the six organisms, simulated
python3 tools/run_gpu_card.py results/sim/gpu_two_wire/eval                  # the two-wire card, modelled
```

Pass: `VERIFICATION: PASS`. Nothing in your systems is touched.

**Level 1 - Watch (read-only).**

```
kubectl apply -f deploy/install/omni-compass.yaml     # set the image line; it runs --mode observe
kubectl -n omni-compass logs deploy/omni-compass -f
```

The install file grants a read-only identity; `scripts/pilot_shadow.sh` records `kubectl auth can-i` receipts that
show it cannot write. Every decision it would take is logged with its reason.
Pass: zero writes, and readings your operators agree with.

**Level 2 - The pods, on top of your autoscalers. WRITES.**
1. Grant `patch horizontalpodautoscalers` and `patch pods/resize` (`deploy/rbac-target.yaml`).
2. Run with `--mode target --latency-file <feed> --slo-ms <your p95 target>`.
3. Optional pod muscles, one at a time:

| Muscle | Switch | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| convey | `--latency-file` and `--cap-deployments ns/name` | gives each machine's idle CPU to the serving pods on it |
| rightsize | `--rightsize-deployments ns/name` | each pod's CPU request follows its measured use times (1 + headroom), in place |
| coldstart | `--coldstart-deployments ns/name --coldstart-signal ns/configmap` | scales a service to zero while no work waits, wakes it when work arrives |
| batch | `--batch` | admits held Jobs labelled `omnicompass.io/batch=true` when there is load and power headroom |
| batch pace | `--batch-pace` | pauses Jobs labelled `omnicompass.io/pausable=true` under power or heat stress, resumes them after |
| rollout guard | `--rollout-guard ns/name` | pauses a rollout while change is not permitted |
| contain | `--contain-namespaces ns --contain-cpu-m <m>` | holds an agent namespace to a CPU budget |
| security hold | `--security-configmap ns/name` | key `hold: "true"` blocks every expansion |

Your HPAs keep scaling as before; Omni-Compass sets their targets and raises floors ahead of bursts.
Pass: p95, p99 and failed requests no worse than native, over paired runs (section 13).

**Level 3 - The machines. WRITES.**
1. Grant `patch nodes` and `patch pods` (`deploy/kind/rbac-omni.yaml`).
2. Run with `--mode nodepool --active-nodes-only --closure /app/law/closure.json --node-scale-cmd "<command with {n}>"`
   and `--node-restore-cmd "<command>"` for the OFF switch. For the compass law on the same levers, use `--law compass`
   (reads the mean response time of the latency window between a tenth of `--slo-ms` and `--slo-ms`, held at
   `--compass-center 0.4`; p95 at the SLO, a blind feed or a waiting pod adds capacity at once; the HPA target never goes
   above the operator's; machines go back one at a time through the release gate).

| Your platform | The park/wake command |
|---|---|
| any cluster, bare metal, kind | `bash scripts/kind_nodepool.sh {n}` |
| Karpenter / EKS Auto Mode | the NodePool CPU limit at `{n}` times node CPU, parked nodes kept |
| Cluster Autoscaler node group | the group's desired size, scale-down through parking |
| OpenShift / OKD | the worker MachineSet replicas, parked |

A machine is given back only when every sense is live, the last order landed, pods are not scaling up, nothing waits
for a place, and the remaining machines stay inside the band.
Pass: fewer machines in service, with no service gauge worse.

**Level 4 - Omni-Compass decides; Kubernetes is the muscle. WRITES.** Add `--strict-replicas`: Omni-Compass decides
each service's replica floor and when to shrink; the HPA stays as the fast reflex upward.
Pass: as level 3.

**Level 5 - A GPU box, two wires. WRITES.**

```
sudo python3 tools/gpu_wire_check.py --gpu 0                    # must end: WIRED RIGHT

## 31. Stack by Stack


Every wiring below is the same plug (section 8): one wire in (the stack's own meter), one wire out (one setting the
stack already accepts), a snapshot taken once before the first write, every write read back, everything restored on
OFF. Native is always the stack's own controller left as shipped; omni is that controller with Omni-Compass on top.

| Stack | Levels | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Vanilla Kubernetes, kind, Rancher | 1-7 | as written |
| Amazon EKS | 1-5 | machines via Cluster Autoscaler node group or Karpenter; CPU power control is not exposed on EC2 VMs; GPUs on bare-metal or full-GPU instances |
| Google GKE, Azure AKS | 1-5 | the provider's node-pool size as the park/wake command; on AKS the managed cluster autoscaler stays native and deletes the machines Omni-Compass idles (10.1) |
| Red Hat OpenShift / OKD | 1-5 | the same permissions through a Role; machines via the worker MachineSet |
| NVIDIA GPU servers without Kubernetes | 5 | the two-wire GPU governor alone |
| Bare-metal CPU servers | 6 | cpufreq and RAPL through sysfs |
| Slurm / HPC | 5 on the GPU nodes | a job-level Slurm connector is not built |
| Building management | 7 | through your BMS's command line or API, in the command templates |
| PostgreSQL behind PgBouncer (any database behind a pooler with a console) | one knob | the pool size through the pooler's own admin console (10.2) |
| A power grid's substation tap changer (pandapower, SimBench) | one knob | the tap position, one whole tap per move (10.3) |
| Buildings with batteries (CityLearn) | one knob a building | the battery's charge and discharge inside the simulator's own limits (10.3) |
| Robot arms (MuJoCo Menagerie) | one knob an axis | the joint speed where the axis has slack; never on an axis at its takt (10.3) |
| A rented cloud machine running the big organisms | the whole harness | the detached run: rent, run, collect, delete (10.4) |
| A message broker's consumer group (Apache Kafka) | one knob | the consumer count inside [1, partitions], read from the consumers' own records; the rebalance paid on every move (10.5) |
| A cache's memory ceiling (Redis) | one knob | `maxmemory` through the cache's own console, grown only while the cache is full (10.6) |
| Drone swarms (gym-pybullet-drones; PX4 and ArduPilot next) | one knob a drone | the cruise override inside the autopilot's limits; a separation wall; collisions void the cell (10.7) |
| A database's storage-engine cache (MongoDB under YCSB) | one knob | the WiredTiger cache size through the server's own console, grown only while the cache is full (10.8) |

### 10.1 Managed Kubernetes on Azure: the bill as the gauge

On Azure Kubernetes Service the muscle is the same as on kind (section 9, levels 1 to 3) and one thing is new: the
bill is real. The workflow `aks-metered` builds a fresh cluster for every arm the same way: a system pool of one
machine, tainted so no workload lands on it (Azure's add-ons and the load generator live there; it is never measured
and never governed), and one or several **work pools** under Azure's own cluster autoscaler, every pool labelled
`omni-role=work`, every pool starting full. Native is that autoscaler alone. Omni on top is the same autoscaler with
Omni-Compass idling the machines it gives back, which the autoscaler then deletes on its own schedule. The bill counts
every work machine that exists, every 15 seconds, priced at Azure's list price for its family (`tools/live_reps.py`,
`POOL_PRICES`); each cluster is deleted when its arm ends, so nothing keeps billing.

**Sizing the fleet to the lever.** The smallest saving a fleet can show is one machine. On 4 workers one machine is
25% of the fleet, so only a saving of about 30% or more can clear the noise; on 15 workers about 10%; on 96 about 3%.
The expected machine saving under Omni-Compass is a few percent, so the 4-worker runs (`results/live/V1_AKS_STEADY.md`,
`V1_AKS_BURST.md`) read no difference beyond the noise on every gauge, which is the honest reading of a fleet too small
for the lever, not a result against it. A new subscription allows 200 vCPUs in a region but 10 per machine family, so
one family gives five 2-vCPU workers; the way past it is **several families at once**: eight pools of four to five
workers each make a fleet of 39 (`worker_pools` input, `size:max,size:max,...`; `pool_prices` names each family's
price). The app's replica ceiling is raised with the fleet (`hpa_max`: nine 200-millicore pods fit one 2-vCPU worker,
so 9 × workers lets the fleet fill), the same in both arms. The preregistered design is in
`docs/K8S_COMPASS_PREREGISTRATION.md`, "The fleet that can show one machine"; the account setup, click by click, in
`docs/AZURE_SETUP.md`.

**What the Azure runs taught us.** Three lessons, each recorded as an amendment to the preregistration before the fleet was
dispatched again. First, a fleet is sized by the lever, not by the budget: a 4-worker fleet cannot show the few-percent
machine saving the law makes, so its honest reading is "inside the noise", and running it again would not change that.
Second, a new subscription's allowance is per machine family, so the fleet that can show one machine is built from nine
families at once, each pool at its own list price, and the bill prices each pool separately. Third, a cloud region can
refuse a new cluster for hours at a time (Azure's capacity for new control planes in its region, on both control-plane
tiers); the harness therefore checks the subscription's allowances before it builds anything, so a refusal costs cents and
not a cluster, and every refusal is recorded with its time.

### 10.2 A database behind its connection pooler

PostgreSQL is wired through PgBouncer, the pooler most of its deployments already run (`docs/POSTGRES_PREREGISTRATION.md`,
`tools/run_pgbench.py`). Nothing models the database. The wire in is the pooler's own report (`SHOW STATS`,
`SHOW POOLS`): once a second, the time a transaction spent in the server plus the time clients waited for one, over the
transactions completed. The wire out is one setting through the pooler's own admin console, `SET default_pool_size`,
inside the cover [2, 90]: never under two server connections, never within ten of PostgreSQL's connection limit. The
compass holds that reading at 40% of a 50 ms line. Where the time was spent decides the direction: waiting for a
server grows the pool; time inside the server shrinks it by one, so fewer backends fight for the same cores; calm gives
back one idle server a second, and only one the pooler itself shows idle. At 95% of the line the knob is handed back
to the pooler's own setting at once. If the knob is found at a value Omni-Compass did not write, it stops writing (one
writer). At the end of every omni arm the pool size is restored to the snapshot and read back. The same plug fits any
pooler or proxy with a console and a pool-size setting (PgBouncer, Pgpool-II, ProxySQL, the application's own pool).

**What the database taught us.** The first untouched run on this stack was a loss, and it stays in the preregistration as
it came (`docs/POSTGRES_PREREGISTRATION.md`, "The first untouched run, and amendment 1"): on the read-only workload the
pooler's own clock read 0.11 ms a transaction against a 50 ms line, so the law gave back one idle connection a second until
the pool stood at its floor of two, while the users' 95th percentile went from 4 ms to 3.9 s. The pooler could not see the
time a client spent behind its own schedule waiting to send, so its clock said calm while the users waited; the
preregistration had said so in one line without drawing the consequence. Amendment 1, declared before any counted run,
made the reading the worse of two: the pooler's service time, or the share of its clients queued for a server, so a pool
too small for the offered rate shows at the pooler as clients waiting and the knob fails up to the operator's setting at
once; and it held the dwell on the brake only, never on the gas. The counted runs are three new untouched runs on the
amended rule; the first run is not counted and is not hidden. The confirmed result is a resource held, not speed, and its
confirmed cost is the host's CPU: the compass's own reads of the pooler's console every second are CPU the native pooler
never spends, and they are counted against it.

### 10.3 Independent simulators, each with its own native controller

Three published simulators are wired the same way, and the simulator's own controller is always native:

- **CityLearn** (`tools/run_citylearn.py`): every district the simulator ships; the knob is each building's battery
  charge and discharge inside the simulator's own limits; the native arm is the simulator's own rule-based control.
- **pandapower on SimBench grids** (`tools/run_pandapower.py`): the knob is the substation tap changer, one whole tap
  per move and a week of evidence before stepping down; the native arm holds the tap at 1.00 per unit as the grid
  ships.
- **MuJoCo Menagerie robot arms** (`tools/run_mujoco.py`): the knob is the joint speed of an axis that has slack; the
  paired physics trial written before the run leaves an axis at its takt native, so UR5e and iiwa 14 have nothing for
  Omni-Compass to move and the Gen3 and Panda do.

Each is preregistered (`docs/CITYLEARN_PREREGISTRATION.md`, `docs/PANDAPOWER_PREREGISTRATION.md`,
`docs/ROBOTICS_PREREGISTRATION.md`), each runs A, B and C as separate GitHub runs, and each table is made by rule
(`tools/citylearn_abc.py`, `tools/pandapower_abc.py`, `tools/mujoco_abc.py`). These are evidence class S: statements
about the simulator's model, never about hardware.

**What the simulators taught us.** Three things a referee should weigh. First, a deterministic simulator makes the
three-run rule stricter, not looser: MuJoCo and pandapower reproduce to the digit on any machine, so their A, B and C must
agree to the digit and any difference is a finding about the harness, while PyBullet reproduces only to a part in a
thousand across machines, which the swarm table discloses as an amendment and tolerates by that much and no more.
Second, a knob that cannot pay is left alone by the physics, not by a rule of thumb: the robot arms' paired trial showed
that two of four arms gain nothing from a speed override and left them native, the cooling model showed that a cap on
cooling power can never remove less heat and so is never a lever, and a battery's reserve is spent only at the wall
because every round trip through the cells costs the efficiency loss (`docs/MECHANISM_OF_ACTION.md`, 9.6). Third, a gain
in one gauge is often a loss in another, and the simulators show both: the grid's losses rise in the four grids with their
own generation while the energy drawn falls everywhere; the buildings' bills rise in the 2023 districts while their peaks
fall; the Panda's copper loss rises while its torque falls. The tables carry every one of those rows, and the index
carries none of them, because they are models.

### 10.4 The big organisms on a rented machine

The four stacked at 1,000 copies (1.7 million modelled muscles) with a real cluster inside takes more than GitHub's
six-hour job limit per repetition, so it runs **detached** (`.github/workflows/big-organism-detached.yml`): `start`
rents one Azure machine, installs the tools, starts every repetition of every organism under `nohup` and leaves the
machine running on its own; `collect` (every two hours on the clock, or by hand) copies the files back when every
repetition has finished, publishes one artifact per cell and deletes the machine; `survey` lists which machine sizes
and quotas a subscription may rent, region by region, and rents nothing. A machine older than `max_hours` is collected
as it is and deleted, so nothing runs forever on the bill. The commit to run is an input, so an older engine can be
run again on the same machine. **The clock rule** (section 13) decides the window for each size on each machine: the
first v3 machine stepped the stack in 31 s against a 12 s step and fell 4,628 s behind its window, so it was stopped,
recorded, and started again with a 10,800 s window and 45 s steps.

### 10.5 A message broker's consumer group

Apache Kafka is wired as an operator runs it (`docs/KAFKA_PREREGISTRATION.md`, `tools/run_kafka.py`): one broker as
shipped, a topic of eight partitions, a consumer group at the operator's count of two. Nothing models the broker. The
wire in is the group's own end-to-end latency: each message carries its production time, each consumer records when its
handling ended, and the reading is the mean over the messages consumed in the last second; a second with nothing consumed
while messages wait reads as the line (someone is waiting and no one is taking), and nothing consumed with nothing
waiting reads as calm. The wire out is the count of consumers in the group, which is what an operator changes, inside the
cover [1, 8]: never fewer than one, never more than the topic has partitions. The compass holds the reading at 40% of a
500 ms line with a response time of 3 s, because a consumer added or removed shows only after the group rebalances. Slow
service with messages waiting adds consumers in proportion to the force; calm with nothing waiting gives back one idle
consumer a second after a five-second dwell; at 95% of the line every consumer the topic can use starts at once. The
rebalance that every move costs is paid by Omni-Compass and counted in the gauges. At the end of every omni arm the count
is handed back to the operator's and read back. The result (section 16) is the shape this wiring predicts: the queue kept
short, no message lost, at the cost of consumers running, which reads worse by rule and stands beside the gain.

### 10.6 A cache's memory ceiling

Redis is wired as Ubuntu ships it, with the two settings an operator sets for a cache, a memory ceiling of 64 MB and the
allkeys-lru eviction rule (`docs/REDIS_PREREGISTRATION.md`, `tools/run_redis.py`). The application in front of it is ours
and declared: 1,500 requests a second from 32 threads on a Zipf working set that widens and narrows one notch at a time;
a miss costs a declared 5 ms trip to the store behind the cache and a write-back. The wire in is the application's own
request latency, the mean over the last second (a hit about 0.3 ms, a miss about 5.5 ms). The wire out is one setting
through Redis's own console, `CONFIG SET maxmemory`, inside the cover [16, 512] MB. The compass holds the reading at 40%
of a 2 ms line. Its direction rule carries the do-no-harm gate in the form this stack needs: misses grow the ceiling by
notches of 8 MB **only while the cache is full** (memory used at 90% of the ceiling or more), because a miss in a cache
with room to spare is a cold miss that no ceiling can mend; calm with nothing evicted in the last second gives back one
notch a second, after a five-second dwell since the last growth; at 95% of the line with the cache full a quarter of the
cover is added at once. One writer: a ceiling found at a value Omni-Compass did not write stops it. At the end of every
omni arm the ceiling is handed back to the operator's 64 MB and read back. The memory the compass holds for a wide
working set is the resource this benchmark trades and reads worse by rule; the gain is the hit rate and the work inside
the line. The result (section 16.4) is exactly that shape: on all three untouched workloads the work inside the line and
the hit rate rose 14% to 27% and the ceiling held rose from 64 MB to 200 to 270 MB, with the host's CPU inside the noise
and every ceiling handed back.

### 10.7 Drone swarms: the autopilot's cruise

In gym-pybullet-drones (University of Toronto, MIT License; `docs/SWARM_PREREGISTRATION.md`, `tools/run_swarm.py`) every
Crazyflie 2.x flies its shipped position controller along the planner's path at the planner's cruise: that is native. The
wire in is each drone's tracking error, the distance between the drone and the point its autopilot was told to be at, on
a band from 0 to a declared safe error of 0.25 m. The wire out is one knob a drone, the cruise override: the fraction of
the planner's cruise the carrot moves at, never under 1.0 (the planner's own) and never over 2.0 (a quarter of the
autopilot's own speed limit), moving by at most 0.01 a control tick. With slack the compass spends it as speed; as the
error grows it eases; at 95% of the safe error the cruise is the planner's at once. Two guards belong to this stack: a
**separation wall** (a drone with another within 0.5 m flies the planner's cruise, whatever the error reads) and the
**paired physics trial** before the counted missions, which asks the simulator's own figures whether a faster mission
costs less energy at all and keeps the error under the safe error; where it does not, the override is left native for
that cell and the cell reads "nothing for Omni to move". Energy is a declared model from the simulator's own motor
constants, said to be a model wherever it is printed; a collision voids the cell. At every landing and at the end of the
run the override is handed back and read back.

### 10.8 A database's storage-engine cache

MongoDB is wired as an operator runs it (`docs/YCSB_PREREGISTRATION.md`, `tools/run_ycsb.py`): the 8.0 series from its
publisher's own signed repository, its configuration as shipped but for the one setting an operator sets for the storage
engine, the WiredTiger cache, at 512 MB. The questions are asked by YCSB, the published cloud-serving benchmark, running its
own core workloads as the project ships them, with the key space stepping one notch at a time through the cache and past
it, so the working set fits the operator's cache at the low notches and outgrows it at the high ones. The wire in is the
server's own mean read latency over the last second, from its `serverStatus` operation latencies, differenced. The wire out
is one setting through the server's own console, `setParameter wiredTigerEngineRuntimeConfig cache_size`, inside the cover
[256 MB, 2,048 MB]: the server's own floor at one end, a quarter of the machine at the other. The compass holds the reading
at 40% of a 2 ms line. The direction rule is the cache's: slow reads grow the cache by notches of 64 MB only while the
cache is full (bytes in it at 90% of its size or more), because slow reads in a cache with room to spare are not the
cache's to mend; calm with no page evicted in the last second gives back one notch a second after a five-second dwell; at
95% of the line with the cache full a quarter of the cover is added at once. One writer, read-back and the hand-back at the
end are the plug's, as everywhere. Disclosed before the run: on a machine where the data files fit in the operating
system's own page cache, a storage-engine cache miss is a read from memory and a decompression, not a disk read, so the
gain available to this knob is smaller than it would be on a machine whose data does not fit in memory; the result will
say what it is. The same plug fits any store whose engine exposes a cache size at run time (InnoDB's buffer pool, RocksDB's
block cache) and any store that does not can only be sized at restart, which is not a knob Omni-Compass moves.

## 32. The Integration Manual



> **Before you wire anything:** read [`DISCLOSURES.md`](../DISCLOSURES.md). Omni-Compass acts only through the wires it is given; it cannot be slapped on. If your paired receipts differ from the published benchmarks in direction, the first presumption is wiring: confirm the installation with section 8.5 of the manual (*Wired right or wired wrong*).

How to wire Omni-Compass into your own systems yourself, from watching only to running your stack from the top. This
manual ships in the box with the code and the license. Nobody from The Omni-Compass LLC needs to be on site.

Read section 1 once, then take the levels in section 4 in order. Each level has a pass condition; go to the next
level only when it holds. The OFF switch (section 2) works at every level.

---

### 1. What is in the box

| Item | Where |
|---|---|
| The engine, nervous system, safety shield, compass and conveyance law | `omnicompass/` |
| The Kubernetes controller and its muscles | `omni_controller/controller.py`, `omni_controller/muscles.py` |
| The GPU governor (one GPU box, no Kubernetes needed) | `omni_controller/gpu_governor.py` |
| Container image recipe; install and permission files | `deploy/Dockerfile`, `deploy/install/omni-compass.yaml`, `deploy/rbac-*.yaml`, `deploy/pilot/` |
| Proof tools: paired tests on your own stack, the GPU test, simulations | `scripts/`, `tools/`, `hardware/` |
| Every check the code must pass | `python3 verify.py` (ends with `VERIFICATION: PASS`) |
| The C++ engine: every law twinned in C++20, proven equal to the Python | `cpp/` (build: `cmake -S cpp -B cpp/build && cmake --build cpp/build`) |
| The seal: the fingerprints that lock each Python law to its C++ twin | `results/SEAL.json`, `python3 tools/seal.py --check` |
| Metrics: every gauge and where it comes from | `docs/METRICS_CATALOG.md` |
| How it compares with what you run today | `docs/COMPARISON.md` |
| The license and notices | `LICENSE`, `NOTICE` |

**License, in short** (the `LICENSE` file governs): you may download, run, modify and test Omni-Compass free of charge
for evaluation, research and non-commercial use, including on your own systems. Commercial use (running it for your
business, selling it or building it into a product or service) needs a paid commercial license from The Omni-Compass
LLC. The copyright and patent notices must stay with every copy.

---

### 2. The rules Omni-Compass keeps on your system

1. **One OFF switch for the whole harness, in a human hand.** `python3 tools/omni_switch.py off` turns every
   Omni-Compass governor on the machine off at once: each returns every setting it changed to the value it recorded
   before it acted, reads each back and exits, and no governor starts again until `python3 tools/omni_switch.py on`
   (`omnicompass/master.py`; the switch file is `OMNI_MASTER_OFF`, by default `/tmp/omni-compass/OFF`). Each governor
   also has its own switch for one muscle at a time: creating its kill file (or setting `OMNI_KILL=1`).
   - Kubernetes controller: `--kill-file` (default `/tmp/omni.kill`).
   - GPU governor: `--kill-file` (default `/tmp/omni-gpu-kill`), or send it SIGTERM.
2. **It records before it acts.** Every original setting is written down first (annotations on the Kubernetes
   objects, the `snapshot` line in the GPU audit), so the OFF switch always knows what to restore.
3. **It watches before it writes.** Every level starts in watch mode: it decides and logs, and writes nothing.
4. **It never goes blind and keeps acting.** If a reading fails (nvidia-smi, metrics, the response-time feed), it
   returns what it changed to the recorded setting at once and gives nothing back until it can see again.
5. **Service first.** While response time is over your target, and for a few decisions after (`--slo-clear`), it may
   not cap power or pack tighter than your own settings.
6. **Every change is read back.** No new order goes on top of one that has not landed.
7. **The living band.** No organ is driven below 5% or above 95% of its range; machines are marked idle, never
   switched off by Omni-Compass; it never evicts or moves a pod.
8. **Everything is logged.** Every read, decision, write and its reason goes to the audit log (`--audit`).

---

### 3. Before you start: what your system needs

| You run | You need |
|---|---|
| Kubernetes (any: vanilla, EKS, GKE, AKS, OpenShift/OKD, Rancher, kind) | Kubernetes 1.34 or newer (in-place pod resize); metrics-server (`kubectl top nodes` works); an HPA with a CPU target on each service to be governed; a readiness probe and a short preStop pause on each service |
| A response-time feed (strongly recommended at every level) | a CSV per service, `elapsed_seconds,latency_ms,ok`, written continuously; `scripts/latency_probe.py` writes one against any HTTP endpoint |
| NVIDIA GPUs | driver with `nvidia-smi`; root (or the capability to run `nvidia-smi -pl`); on a VM, full GPU passthrough (container or "pod" GPU rentals usually block power-limit changes) |
| CPU power control | Linux cpufreq with the schedutil governor (`/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq`); RAPL for package watts (`/sys/class/powercap/intel-rapl`); usually bare metal only, since cloud VMs rarely expose these |
| Site power and cooling | a command that prints site watts, and (for cooling) a command that sets the supply-air setpoint through your building management system |

Build the image once:
```
docker build -f deploy/Dockerfile -t <your-registry>/omni-compass:<tag> .
docker push <your-registry>/omni-compass:<tag>
```
It runs as non-root, with a read-only root filesystem and no Linux capabilities.

---

### 4. The levels, from watching to running the stack

#### Level 0. Evaluate without touching anything
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 verify.py                       # every check; ends with VERIFICATION: PASS
python3 tools/gpu_physics_sim.py        # the GPU governor against a modelled NVIDIA card
python3 hardware/node_exchange.py       # CPU and GPU on one power budget, modelled
```
**Pass condition:** `VERIFICATION: PASS`. Nothing in your systems is touched.

#### Level 1. Watch (read-only)
```
kubectl apply -f deploy/install/omni-compass.yaml     # set the image line; it runs --mode observe
kubectl -n omni-compass logs deploy/omni-compass -f
```
- The install file grants a read-only identity. `scripts/pilot_shadow.sh` records `kubectl auth can-i` receipts that
  show it cannot write.
- Every decision it would take is logged with its reason; nothing is written.

**Pass condition:** zero writes, and readings your operators agree with.

#### Level 2. The pods, on top of your autoscalers
1. Grant `patch horizontalpodautoscalers` and `patch pods/resize` (`deploy/rbac-target.yaml`).
2. Run with `--mode target --latency-file <feed> --slo-ms <your p95 target>`.
3. Optional pod muscles, one at a time:

| Muscle | Switch | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| convey | on with `--latency-file` and `--cap-deployments ns/name` | gives each machine's idle CPU to the serving pods on it (default: always); `--convey-on 0.5 --convey-off 0.25` engages it only while response time is over half the target |
| rightsize | `--rightsize-deployments ns/name` | each pod's CPU request follows its measured use × (1 + headroom), in place |
| coldstart | `--coldstart-deployments ns/name --coldstart-signal ns/configmap` | scales a service to zero while no work waits, wakes it the moment work arrives |
| batch | `--batch` | admits held Jobs labelled `omnicompass.io/batch=true` when there is load and power headroom |
| batch pace | `--batch-pace` | pauses Jobs labelled `omnicompass.io/pausable=true` under power or heat stress, resumes them after |
| rollout guard | `--rollout-guard ns/name` | pauses a rollout while change is not permitted, undoes one past its deadline when rollback is authorised |
| contain | `--contain-namespaces ns --contain-cpu-m <m>` | holds an agent namespace to a CPU budget with a quota |
| security hold | `--security-configmap ns/name` | key `hold: "true"` blocks every expansion |

Your HPAs keep scaling as before. Omni-Compass sets their targets and raises floors ahead of bursts.

**Pass condition:** p95, p99 and failed requests no worse than your own, over paired runs (section 6).

#### Level 3. The machines
1. Grant `patch nodes` and `patch pods` (`deploy/kind/rbac-omni.yaml`).
2. Run with `--mode nodepool --active-nodes-only --closure /app/law/closure.json --node-scale-cmd "<command with {n}>"`.

| Your platform | The park/wake command |
|---|---|
| any cluster, bare metal, kind | `bash scripts/kind_nodepool.sh {n}`: close machines to new work and mark them first to go; open again, warm machines first |
| Karpenter / EKS Auto Mode | the NodePool CPU limit at `{n} × node CPU`, parked nodes kept, not consolidated away |
| Cluster Autoscaler node group | the group's desired size, scale-down through parking, not deletion |
| OpenShift / OKD | the worker MachineSet replicas, parked, not deleted |

A machine is given back only when every sense is live, the last order landed, pods are not scaling up, nothing waits
for a place, and the remaining machines stay inside the band.

**Pass condition:** fewer machines in service and less energy, with no service gauge worse.

#### Level 4. Omni-Compass decides; Kubernetes is the muscle
Add `--strict-replicas`: Omni-Compass decides each service's replica floor and when to shrink; your HPA stays as the
fast reflex upward; the node law sizes the machines.

**Pass condition:** as level 3.

#### Level 5. A GPU box (with or without Kubernetes)
The GPU governor runs on any Linux machine with NVIDIA GPUs:
```
## watch: decides and logs, writes nothing
sudo python3 -m omni_controller.gpu_governor --mode watch --gpus 0,1,2,3 --audit /var/log/omni/gpu.jsonl \
     --latency-file <feed> --slo-ms <p95 target>
## cap: writes the power limits
sudo python3 -m omni_controller.gpu_governor --mode cap   --gpus 0,1,2,3 --audit /var/log/omni/gpu.jsonl \
     --latency-file <feed> --slo-ms <p95 target>
## OFF
sudo touch /tmp/omni-gpu-kill
```
What it does, every `--interval` seconds (default 2):
- reads each GPU's own meter: power draw, temperature, utilization, power limit;
- the engine sets a power cap; the shield keeps it above `--min-share` × the start limit (0.70) and above
  draw × (1 + `--headroom`);
- a busy card (smoothed utilization at or over `--util-gate`, 0.5) gets its full limit back at once;
- a response-time breach or a failed reading returns the start limit at once.

**Speed lock (optional).** Keep every response-time gauge at least `--speed-gain` (1%) faster than without
Omni-Compass, and spend any speed won elsewhere on watts:
```
python3 tools/gpu_baseline.py baseline.json native-run/latency.csv     # a run without Omni-Compass, other days
sudo python3 -m omni_controller.gpu_governor --mode cap --baseline-file baseline.json --latency-file <feed> ...
```
**Prove it on your card:** `sudo bash scripts/gpu_paired.sh` runs native, watch and Omni-Compass back to back on the
same machine and prints the table and verdict (`docs/GPU_RUN_GUIDE.md`).

**Pass condition:** work per energy up, and requests served and p95 inside the guardrails.

#### Level 6. CPU clock and power
Add to the Kubernetes controller, on bare metal:
```
--cpufreq-policy-root /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq --cpufreq-require-schedutil \
--rapl-cmd "<prints CPU package watts>"
```
The CPU frequency ceiling follows the engine's cap inside the nervous system's envelope; the OFF switch writes every
policy's recorded maximum back exactly. GPUs can be wired the same way from the controller:
`--gpu-query-cmd "nvidia-smi --query-gpu=power.draw,temperature.gpu --format=csv,noheader,nounits" --gpu-power-cmd "nvidia-smi -pl {w}" --gpu-max-w <max>`.

**Pass condition:** energy per unit of work down, no service gauge worse.

#### Level 7. Site power, cooling, batteries
| Organ | Switch | Status |
|---|---|---|
| site power stress | `--power-cmd "<prints site watts>" --site-limit-w <limit>` | wired: power stress enters the engine; batch pace and caps respond |
| cooling setpoint | `--cooling-cmd "<sets {c}>" --cooling-min-c 18 --cooling-max-c 27 --cooling-restore-c 22` | wired: warmer supply air while cool, colder as heat rises |
| **CPU + GPU on one power budget** | `hardware/node_exchange.py` (the conveyance law over CPU and GPU organs) | **simulation only.** The live levers exist (levels 5 and 6); the exchange between them has not run on hardware |
| GPU groups sharing a site budget | `hardware/site_exchange.py` | **simulation only** |
| on-site batteries as an organ | designed (`docs/DOMAIN_MAP.md`) | **not built** |

---

### 5. Stack by stack

| Stack | Levels available | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Vanilla Kubernetes, kind, Rancher | 1-6 | as written |
| Amazon EKS | 1-5 | nodes via Cluster Autoscaler node group or Karpenter NodePool (level 3 table); CPU power control is not exposed on EC2 VMs; GPUs on bare-metal or full-GPU instances |
| Google GKE, Azure AKS | 1-5 | as EKS, with the provider's node-pool size as the park/wake command |
| Red Hat OpenShift / OKD | 1-5 | OpenShift is Kubernetes underneath; grant the same permissions through a Role; machines via the worker MachineSet |
| NVIDIA GPU servers without Kubernetes | 5 | the GPU governor alone |
| Bare-metal CPU servers | 6 | cpufreq and RAPL through sysfs |
| Slurm / HPC schedulers | 5 on the GPU nodes | a Slurm connector for job-level decisions is not built |
| Building management (cooling, power meters) | 7 | through your BMS's command line or API, wrapped in the command templates |
| Azure AKS, the bill as the gauge | 1-3 | Azure's managed cluster autoscaler stays native and deletes the machines Omni-Compass idles; one or several work pools (`worker_pools`), the replica ceiling raised with the fleet (`hpa_max`); a fleet of 4 cannot show a saving of one machine, 39 can (manual, section 10.1; `docs/AZURE_SETUP.md`) |
| PostgreSQL behind PgBouncer, or any pooler with a console | one knob | the pool size through the pooler's own admin console, cover [2, 90], one writer, restored on OFF (manual, section 10.2; `docs/POSTGRES_PREREGISTRATION.md`) |
| Apache Kafka, or any consumer group an operator sizes | one knob | the consumer count inside [1, partitions], the group's own end-to-end latency as the reading, the rebalance paid on every move, handed back on OFF (manual, section 10.5; `docs/KAFKA_PREREGISTRATION.md`) |
| Redis, or any cache with a console and a memory ceiling | one knob | `maxmemory` through the cache's own console, cover [16, 512] MB, grown only while the cache is full (a cold miss is not the ceiling's), one writer, restored on OFF (manual, section 10.6; `docs/REDIS_PREREGISTRATION.md`) |
| Drone swarms (gym-pybullet-drones; PX4 and ArduPilot next) | one knob a drone | the cruise override inside the autopilot's limits, a separation wall, the paired physics trial, collisions void the cell (manual, section 10.7; `docs/SWARM_PREREGISTRATION.md`) |
| MongoDB, or any store whose engine exposes its cache size at run time | one knob | the storage-engine cache through the server's own console, cover [256, 2,048] MB, grown only while the cache is full, one writer, restored on OFF (manual, section 10.8; `docs/YCSB_PREREGISTRATION.md`) |
| A rented cloud machine running the big organisms | the whole harness | `big-organism-detached`: start, collect, survey; the clock rule sets the window (manual, section 10.4) |
| Independent simulators (CityLearn, pandapower, MuJoCo) | one knob each | the simulator's own controller is native; preregistered, A/B/C (manual, section 10.3) |

---

### 6. Proving it on your own system

1. **Paired runs.** Run your service the same way twice, once as you run it today and once with Omni-Compass on top,
   back to back on the same machines, order rotated, at least 5 times (10 for a result you publish).
   `scripts/kind_paired.sh` and `tools/live_reps.py` do this and print each gauge with its 95% interval. A change is
   proven only when its interval excludes zero.
2. **The switch drill,** after every run: turn Omni-Compass OFF, confirm every setting is back at its recorded
   original and no `omnicompass.io/*` annotation remains, turn it ON.
3. **Read the results** with `docs/METRICS_CATALOG.md`: every gauge says whether it is measured or modelled.

---

### 7. Reading the log

| Line | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `gate: a sense is blind` | a reading failed; nothing is given back until it returns |
| `gate: pods scaling up` | pods first, machines after |
| `decision failed (n in a row)` | the cluster could not be reached; nothing was written. Turn it OFF for native at once |
| `convey: <machine> idle CPU to its k serving pod(s), limit c` | that machine's idle CPU now reaches the work on it |
| `convey: response time calm, operator's limit` | the pods are back at your own CPU limit |
| `busy gate: utilization u, the limit read at start` | a busy GPU got its full power limit back |
| `speed lock: worst ratio r vs line 0.99 (spend / hold / release)` | the speed lock's reading and what it did |
| `response-time reflex: the limit read at start` | response time went over target; full power at once |
| `reset: the limit read at start` | the OFF switch restored this setting |

---

### 8. What is proven, and how

| Claim | Evidence | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| On real Kubernetes, Omni v1, three runs of ten pairs each: more work inside the response line (+42% to +48%), p95 −57% to −69%, machines fewer where a paired trial allowed it (steady −1.5% to −3.4%, batch −15% to −24%) | `results/live/V1_ALL_FOUR.md`, `V1_STEADY.md`, `V1_WANDERING.md`, `V1_FAULTS.md`, `V1_BATCH.md`, `V1_FAIRNESS.md` | measured on kind; read by the three-run rule (`docs/OMNI_V1.md`) |
| On a real database, Omni v3: 61% to 72% fewer connections held open for the same work and latency, at +14% to +28% host CPU-seconds (confirmed worse, reported) | `results/live/V3_PGBENCH.md` | measured on GitHub's machines |
| On Azure's bill, 4 workers: no difference beyond the noise on any gauge (the fleet is too small for the lever) | `results/live/V1_AKS_STEADY.md`, `V1_AKS_BURST.md` | a real bill |
| Energy on Kubernetes | declared model on kind, no meter | modelled |
| GPU: more work per energy within the speed guardrail | earlier card controller, obsolete; rerun on rented cards pending | hardware meter |
| CPU and GPU on one power budget: more work, never over the budget | `results/hardware/NODE_EXCHANGE_*.json` | modelled |
| Safety: OFF switch restores everything; watch mode writes nothing | every live run's switch drill; `verify.py` | measured / checked |

### 9. Python, C++ and the seal

Omni-Compass exists in two languages. The laws are twinned: each has a Python version and a C++20 version that give
the same answers, proven by a parity test on every build.

| Law | Python | C++ | Proven by |
|---|---|---|---|
| core engine (six-state equations) | `omnicompass/core.py` | `cpp/src/core.cpp` | 500 frozen fixtures |
| governor (allocation laws) | `omnicompass/adapter.py` | `cpp/src/governor.cpp` | `tests/test_cpp_governor_parity.py` |
| safety shield | `omnicompass/shield.py` | `cpp/src/shield.cpp` | `tests/test_cpp_shield_parity.py` (plus adversarial cases) |
| HPA replica law | `fleet/harness.py` | `cpp/src/hpa.cpp` | `tests/test_cpp_hpa_parity.py` |
| closure law (machines) | `omnicompass/closure.py` | `cpp/src/closure.cpp` | `tests/test_cpp_closure_parity.py` |
| conveyance law (the conserved budget) | `omnicompass/conveyance.py` | `cpp/src/conveyance.cpp` | `tests/test_cpp_conveyance_parity.py` (identical to the last bit) |
| nervous system (authority per organ, living band) | `omnicompass/nervous_system.py` | `cpp/src/nervous_system.cpp` | `tests/test_cpp_twins_parity.py` |
| compass and ledger (composite storage) | `omnicompass/compass.py`, `omnicompass/storage.py` | `cpp/src/compass.cpp` | `tests/test_cpp_twins_parity.py` |
| GPU governor rules (shield limit, busy gate, speed lock, window, baseline) | `omni_controller/gpu_governor.py` | `cpp/src/gpu_rules.cpp` | `tests/test_cpp_twins_parity.py` |

**The seal** (`results/SEAL.json`) holds the SHA-256 fingerprint of every file of every twin, written only after all
parity tests pass (`python3 tools/seal.py`). `verify.py` fails if any sealed file changes afterwards, and names it. So
the Python and the C++ cannot drift apart unnoticed. What stays in Python is the plumbing that talks to Kubernetes,
nvidia-smi and sensors (`omni_controller/controller.py`, `muscles.py`, the device I/O of `gpu_governor.py`) and the
simulation harnesses; every decision they take goes through the twinned laws. The seal lists them as Python only.

Keep this manual with the code. When Omni-Compass changes, this manual, the C++ twin and the seal change in the same
commit.

## 33. Running the GPU Benchmark



> **Before you wire anything:** read [`DISCLOSURES.md`](../DISCLOSURES.md). Omni-Compass acts only through the wires it is given; it cannot be slapped on. If your paired receipts differ from the published benchmarks in direction, the first presumption is wiring: confirm the installation with section 8.5 of the manual (*Wired right or wired wrong*).

There are three ways to get real-machine numbers:
- **Your own tower:** a machine you control, with a smart plug measuring the whole machine at the wall (section A).
- **GitHub's GPU machines:** they run the test from the repository with one click (section B).
- **A rented cloud GPU:** sections 1 to 6.

### A. Your own tower, measured at the wall

You need:
- an NVIDIA graphics card (a GeForce RTX works);
- Linux on that machine (a spare drive or a USB boot is fine);
- a smart plug that reports watts, for example a Shelly Plus Plug or any plug running Tasmota, which cost about
  $20 to $30.

Plug the tower into the smart plug, and connect the plug to your home Wi-Fi with its own app. Note its IP address,
shown in the app or on your router's device list. Then on the tower:

```bash
python3 tools/wall_meter.py shelly2:192.168.1.50 --once        # prints the tower's watts right now
sudo WALL_METER=shelly2:192.168.1.50 bash scripts/gpu_paired.sh                  # trial run
sudo WALL_METER=shelly2:192.168.1.50 PHASE=confirm bash scripts/gpu_paired.sh    # the real test
```

Use `shelly1:` for older Shelly plugs and `tasmota:` for Tasmota plugs. The table then adds whole-machine energy at
the wall and requests served per wall kilojoule. The plug is read by the test only; Omni never sees it, so its number
is independent of Omni.

### B. GitHub's own GPU machines

1. **One-time setup, by an owner of the Omni-Compass organisation on GitHub:**
   1. Go to **Settings → Actions → Runners → New runner → New GitHub-hosted runner**.
   2. Choose the image **NVIDIA GPU-Optimized Image for Linux** and a GPU size.
   3. Name its label `gpu-t4`, or set the repository variable `GPU_RUNNER` to the label you chose.

   GPU runners are billed per minute on paid plans.
2. **To run:** go to **Actions → gpu-bench → Run workflow**, then choose `smoke` or `confirm`.
3. **Results:** each repetition runs on its own GPU machine. The results are pooled into one table, shown on the run's
   summary page, and every raw file is committed back to the branch under `results/gpu/github-<run id>/`.

If GitHub's machines don't allow changing the GPU power limit, the job stops in its first minute and says so.

### C. A rented cloud GPU

This costs roughly $10 to $25 in rented GPU time. You type a
handful of commands; the machine does the rest.

### 1. Rent the right kind of machine

The test changes the GPU's power limit, so you need a machine where you are the full administrator of the GPU:

- **Use a virtual machine (VM) or a bare-metal server.** Lambda Cloud "on-demand instances" are VMs; so are the GPU
  instances on AWS, Google Cloud and Azure.
- **Avoid "container" or "pod" rentals.** Their GPUs usually block power-limit changes. This is common on the cheapest
  per-hour marketplaces.
- **Any single NVIDIA data-center GPU works:** A10, L4, A100, H100, L40S. One GPU is enough.
- **Choose an image that already has PyTorch.** On Lambda that is the default "Lambda Stack" image.

You don't have to guess whether a machine allows it. In its first minute the test checks, and stops with *"cannot set
the power limit (run as root)"* if the machine doesn't allow it. If you see that, shut the machine down (you pay only
for the minutes used) and rent a different kind.

### 2. Connect to it

The rental site shows a command like `ssh ubuntu@123.45.67.89`. Paste it into Terminal (Mac) or PowerShell (Windows).

### 3. Get the code

On the rented machine (the repository is public while the benchmarks run; if it is private, use a read-only
fine-grained token in the URL):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/The-Omni-Compass-LLC/The-Omni-Compass the-omni-compass
cd the-omni-compass
git log --oneline -1       # the commit you are about to test; write it down
pip install -r requirements.txt
nvidia-smi                 # should show your GPU
```

### 4. The whole test, one command (about 45 hours)

```bash
sudo nohup bash scripts/gpu_rented_run.sh > run.log 2>&1 &
tail -f run.log            # Ctrl+C stops watching; the test keeps running
```

It runs, in order, and stops at the first failure:
1. the machine check (one copy only, nothing else on the card, the card's default limit and clock range restored);
2. the **wire check**, which must end `WIRED RIGHT` (manual, section 8.4);
3. the smoke test, about 40 minutes, never counted;
4. the preregistered confirmation on compute-bound work: 10 repetitions × native / watch / Omni, 600 s each, about
   6 hours;
5. the second preregistered confirmation on AI token generation (memory-bound), the same design, about 6 hours
   (`SKIP_DECODE=1` skips it); each is its own result, never pooled. Both are packed into one file as soon as they
   finish: `results/gpu/omni-gpu-<stamp>-confirmations.tar.gz`;
6. **an operator's power cap underneath** (70% of the card's default limit): the cap alone vs the cap with
   Omni-Compass on top, at the usual load and fully loaded (more work from the same watts), about 3 hours
   (`SKIP_CAP=1` skips it);
7. **the GPU fault drill**, about 10 minutes: the governor killed outright, the master switch pulled, the response
   feed blind; every check must pass (`SKIP_DRILL=1` skips it). Everything so far is then packed into
   `results/gpu/omni-gpu-<stamp>-partial.tar.gz`;
8. the six organisms with this card inside, each as **1, 10, 100 and 1,000 copies** on one clock (3, 3, 2 and 1
   repetitions), about 25 hours; the 1,000-copy stacks need a longer step than 2 s, measured on the machine and stated
   in the receipt (`SKIP_HIL=1` skips this stage);
9. **real AI serving** last: a small open language model served by vLLM, about 2 hours (`SKIP_LLM=1` skips it); if
   vLLM cannot install on the machine, the stage says so and nothing before it changes;
10. one packed file: `== send this one file back: results/gpu/omni-gpu-<stamp>.tar.gz`, with the label each table chose
   by rule.

To stop everything at any moment: `sudo python3 tools/omni_switch.py off` turns every Omni-Compass governor off and
hands the card back to its own settings.

Do not start it twice and do not use the card for anything else while it runs.

### 5. Bring the results back

Download `results/gpu/omni-gpu-<stamp>.tar.gz` (in JupyterLab: right-click, Download; or `scp` from your own computer).
It holds every raw reading, every table, the verdict and the checksums. **Then shut the rented machine down** on the
rental site, so the billing stops.

### 6. Read it before you believe it

Open `results/gpu/run-<stamp>/GPU_REPS.md` and check the rows of the manual's section 8.5 (*Wired right or wired
wrong*): watch equal to native, requests equal, the card's busy clock under Omni at or above its own, the lid while busy
at or above its own busy draw, fail-up rare in the credit-per-write table. If a row reads wired wrong, the run says
nothing about Omni-Compass until the wiring is fixed (`DISCLOSURES.md`, section 3).

### D. The 8-GPU result: every card of one server at once

The same test as section C, on a machine with several cards (Lambda "8x A100" or "8x H100", a VM, the Lambda Stack
image). Every card runs its own paired test at the same moment, sharing the server's power supply, cooling and
neighbours' heat, as in a real data center. Each card starts its arm rotation one step later than the card before it,
so at any moment some cards run native and some run Omni-Compass.

Get the code as in step 3, then:

```bash
sudo nohup bash scripts/gpu_8card.sh > run8.log 2>&1 &
tail -f run8.log
```

Each card: wire check, envelope, smoke, the compute confirmation, the AI token generation confirmation, the operator's
power cap underneath (about 15 to 16 hours, all cards together). Then the fault drill once on card 0, with every other
card idle. Then one pooled table per workload (every repetition of every card, each paired within its own card: 80
repetitions per workload on 8 cards) and each card's own table. `SKIP_DECODE=1 SKIP_CAP=1` runs the compute
confirmation alone, about 6.5 hours. **Every 8-GPU run has a hard time budget** (`MAX_HOURS`; by default 10.5 hours with `POOLED=1`, 4 with `FAST=1`, 26
for the whole design): at the budget the master switch hands every card back, the stages still running stop, and what
finished is packed and printed as the file to send back. Lambda bills until the instance is terminated, so terminate it
when that line appears. **`sudo POOLED=1 nohup bash scripts/gpu_8card.sh &` runs every stage with the repetitions pooled across the cards
(3 per card per confirmation, 24 per test on 8 cards; 2 per power cap load; 1 per organism size), about 9 to 10 hours.**
`sudo FAST=1 nohup bash scripts/gpu_8card.sh > run8.log 2>&1 &` is a short
look, about 3.5 hours: 3 repetitions per card (24 on 8 cards), then one model across every card; it leaves AI token
generation, the power cap and the whole stacks out, so it is never the result to show. Last, the whole server as one: a language model (Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, open)
served across every card at once by vLLM, one Omni-Compass governor per card, the server's total GPU energy, about
2 hours (`SKIP_LLM=1` skips it). Before it, **the whole stacks with a real card inside**: the six organisms at 1, 10,
100 and 1,000 copies, native and Omni, the full repetitions (3, 3, 2, 1 by size), each organism on its own card at
the same time, so the stage that takes about 25 hours on one card takes the time of its longest organism (the four
stacked, at 1,000 copies), about 4 to 6 hours (`SKIP_HIL=1` skips it). The whole design, every stage:
about 22 to 24 hours. Progress: `tail -f results/gpu/8card-<stamp>/card-*.log`. At the end: `== send this one file back:
results/gpu/omni-8card-<stamp>.tar.gz`. The master switch (`sudo python3 tools/omni_switch.py off`) stops every card's
governor at once.

### E. Your own serving engine

own vLLM? Start it as you always do, then:

```bash
sudo LLM_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000 LLM_MODEL=<your model name> GPU=0 ENVELOPE=<envelope.json> OUT=results/gpu/mine \
  bash scripts/gpu_vllm.sh
```

The same paired test (your engine alone against your engine with Omni-Compass on top) runs against it; nothing is
installed or started. `GPU=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7` when your engine spans several cards. Make the envelope once with
`python3 tools/declare_envelope.py envelope.json --gpu 0`.

### F. Whole-server power from the server itself

The bench records the whole machine's watts beside the cards' own when you give it a meter: `WALL_METER=redfish:<BMC
address>` (with `REDFISH_USER` and `REDFISH_PASSWORD`, read only), `WALL_METER=ipmi:local` (the server's management
controller, read on the machine), or a smart plug (`tools/wall_meter.py` lists them). Omni-Compass never reads it.

### Before any machine: the simulated card

`python3 tools/gpu_physics_sim.py --out results/gpu/sim/after` runs Omni's own GPU governor, with its current
settings, against a modelled card for 10 paired repetitions in about two minutes. No GPU is needed. Every number it
prints comes from the card model, not from a meter, so it is a preview of what the governor does and never the result.
`results/gpu/sim/before` holds the same run with the settings before the share floor and busy gate were added.

### What you will get

A table from the GPU's own power meter:
- native against Omni watching only, and native against Omni governing;
- the preregistered primary result: work per energy, in requests served per kilojoule, with its 95% interval.

It ends with one verdict line, one of:
- **better, proven**;
- **worse, proven**;
- **not proven**;
- **better on energy, fails the service guardrail**.

Whatever it says is the answer, and it is the first number in this project that Omni-Compass's own code did not
compute.

# Part Six. Operating It

*The OFF switch, the rules the governor obeys, the log it keeps, and the care of a running installation.*


## 34. The OFF Switch, the Rules, and the Log


**The rules Omni-Compass keeps on your system.**
1. **The master switch, for the whole harness, in a human hand:** `python3 tools/omni_switch.py off` turns every
   Omni-Compass governor on the machine off at once (the Kubernetes controller and the GPU governors). Each puts every
   setting it ever wrote back to the value it read before its first write, reads it back and exits; the command waits
   until all have, and says so. While the switch is OFF, no governor will start. `python3 tools/omni_switch.py on` allows
   them to be started again (nothing restarts by itself); `status` shows the switch and every governor running. Use it
   the moment anything looks wrong, including a suspected breach. Each governor also keeps its own switch for one
   muscle at a time: the kill file (or `OMNI_KILL=1`, or SIGTERM to the GPU governor).
   **If a governor dies without handing back** (killed outright, the machine crashed, it hung), nothing it wrote is
   left in place: every governor records, before its first write, the exact commands that put every setting back, and
   renews a lease every decision. Run `python3 tools/omni_switch.py watchdog` as its own service next to the governors:
   it hands back for any governor whose process is gone or whose lease has run out (a hung one is stopped first).
   `status` names any governor that died without handing back.
2. It records before it acts (annotations on Kubernetes objects; the `snapshot` line in the GPU audit).
3. It watches before it writes.
4. It never acts blind.
5. Service first: while response time is over its target, and for `--slo-clear` decisions after, nothing is given back.
6. Every change is read back; no new order goes on top of one that has not landed.
7. The living band and the cover: no organ is driven outside its range; machines are parked, never switched off by
   Omni-Compass; it never evicts or moves a pod.
8. One writer: if anyone else changes a knob, Omni-Compass stops writing it and leaves it alone.
9. Everything is logged: every read, decision, write and reason goes to the audit log.

**The three ways a governor stops, and what each leaves behind.** A referee or an underwriter should know exactly what
happens to a governed system in each of the three ways Omni-Compass can stop, because the answer is the same in all
three: every setting at native, read back, with no record left.

- **The reset** (the brake held to the floor) is the planned end of a run. The governor sees its reset file, hands every
  setting back in reverse order of power-up, reads each back, writes its last audit line and exits 0. Every benchmark arm
  ends with one and then checks the cluster from outside the governor: the HPA target at the operator's, the replica range
  as set, every pod's CPU limit at its shipped value, every worker back in service, no `omnicompass.io/` annotation left on
  any object. An arm whose reset check fails is invalid and is left out of the table, never counted.
- **The kill switch** (security) is the unplanned end of trust. `tools/omni_switch.py off` writes the switch file and
  sends every registered governor SIGTERM; each performs the same hand-back as a reset and exits; the command waits until
  all have and reports any that have not. No governor starts while the switch is off. It is one switch for the whole
  machine, not one per muscle, because the case it exists for, something driving a system through Omni-Compass's brain, is
  not a case for picking which muscle to stop.
- **A death without a hand-back** (killed outright, a crash, a hang) is the case the lease covers. Before its first write
  every governor registers itself with the exact command that puts every setting back
  (`omni_controller.controller --restore-only`, which restores from the snapshot annotations on the objects themselves,
  so it needs no memory of the dead process), and renews a lease every decision. The watchdog
  (`tools/omni_switch.py watchdog`), run as its own service beside the governors, finds any governor whose process is gone
  or whose lease is older than its limit (five decision periods, at least two minutes), stops a hung one, runs its
  recorded restore command, and records what it did. The robustness benchmark (section 16, in preparation) kills the
  governor outright in the middle of a governed run and measures how many seconds pass before every setting is back and
  what the service saw in that gap.

**Reading the log.**

| Line | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `gate: a sense is blind` | a reading failed; nothing is given back until it returns |
| `gate: pods scaling up` | pods first, machines after |
| `decision failed (n in a row)` | the cluster could not be reached; nothing was written; turn it OFF for native |
| `decided_by: compass` | the compass set the wires this decision |
| `decided_by: fail_up` / `blind_fail_up` | the service crossed the 0.95 wall, or a sense went blind: full capacity at once |
| `decided_by: thermal_hold` | the card reported a heat slowdown; nothing was tightened |
| `foreign_writer` | someone else changed a knob; Omni-Compass now observes only |
| `restored ... ok: true` | the OFF switch put every setting back and read it back |
| `"watchdog": "handed back"` (in the watchdog's own log) | a governor died or hung without handing back; the watchdog ran its recorded restore command; `ok` says whether every command exited 0 |
| `cruise: on` / `cruise: off` | work waited for a place for two decisions: every machine in service; the line has been empty for two: cruise ends |
| `emergency_brake` | the work is done and demand is at zero: straight to the floor in one move |
| `verdict_state: left native` | no step of the slow knob passed the paired trial: the knob is never moved on this muscle |
| `shield_interventions` | the shield clipped a write to its bounds or its step limit; the count says how often |
| `overhead` (the last line of the audit) | the governor's own CPU over the window: its process and every command it ran |

**How to read an audit from end to end.** The audit (`audit.jsonl`, one JSON record a line, every line timestamped) is the
governor's complete account of itself, and a reader can follow a run through it without the manual: the first lines are
the snapshot (every setting as found, written to the objects as annotations so a watchdog can restore from them); then,
every decision, the readings (the response time and its age, the pods waiting, the machines seen, whether any sense is
blind), the compass's position and force (`compass`), the authority the nervous system granted and the release gate's
reason (`authority`, `node_gate`), the decision itself (the machines recommended against the machines seen, the HPA
target set), every write with the command that made it and the value read back, and the decision's wall time
(`decision_ms`); in cruise, the floor step's silence; at the end, the reset's writes and read-backs and the `overhead`
record. The benchmark harness prints a decision trail from the audit at the end of every omni arm (`scripts/kind_bench.sh`),
one line a decision, so a reviewer reading a run's log sees what the governor saw and did at each minute.


## 35. Maintenance, Upgrades and Security


- Run `python3 verify.py` after every upgrade; it must end `VERIFICATION: PASS`.
- Upgrade in watch mode first; take the levels again from level 1.

**What an upgrade is, and what it is not.** The engine is frozen and fingerprinted (section 15). An upgrade that changes
any engine file, a rule, a gain, a guard, a preset or a muscle, is by definition the next engine version, and every
published result is run again on it before it is quoted beside the old ones; `tools/omni_version.py` says which version a
checkout carries, and a checkout that matches none says which files differ. An upgrade that changes only the harness,
the tools, the tables or this manual leaves the engine's fingerprint as it was and every result standing; the robustness
harness of section 16.8 is an example, built without touching an engine file. An operator can therefore tell, from one
command, whether a new checkout is the engine the results were made on or something that must prove itself again.
- The container runs non-root, read-only, with no capabilities; the Kubernetes identity has only the permissions of
  the level you run.
- The GPU governor needs root only for `nvidia-smi -pl` and `-lgc`.
- Report a security issue as `SECURITY.md` describes.

**Least privilege, proven on every run.** The Kubernetes governor runs as its own service account
(`deploy/kind/rbac-omni.yaml`) with exactly the verbs the level needs: patch on the governed HPA, nodes, pods and the
governed deployment, get on its security ConfigMap, create on pod evictions. It cannot delete nodes, create or delete pods
or deployments, touch the load generator or anything in `kube-system`, read any secret, create a namespace, or write its
own security hold. Every benchmark arm records `kubectl auth can-i` for each of these and fails if a "cannot" reads yes
or a "can" reads no (`bench-*/rbac_omni.txt` in every archived run). The security hold itself is a ConfigMap another
identity owns: when its key reads `hold: "true"` every expansion is blocked, and the governor cannot clear it.

**What never leaves the repository.** Cloud credentials live only in the repository's encrypted secrets and are used
only by the workflows that need them; no credential, key or token appears in any file, log, table or commit, and the
founder is never asked for one in conversation. The repository carries SPDX license identifiers on every source file so
that license scanners (Black Duck, FOSSA, Snyk) read the evaluation license correctly, and every generated report carries
the legal notice at its head and foot (`tools/legal.py`). Patent, copyright and trademark filings are referred to as
filed; no filing number appears anywhere.

**Supply chain.** Everything the benchmarks download is pinned and checked: metrics-server by version and SHA-256
(`scripts/kind_bench.sh`), Apache Kafka against the Apache Software Foundation's own SHA-512 file for that release,
Redis as the Ubuntu runner's own package, gym-pybullet-drones at one named commit, Python packages by
`requirements.txt`. A download whose checksum does not match stops the run before anything else happens.

## 36. The Operator Manual



> **Before you wire anything:** read [`DISCLOSURES.md`](../DISCLOSURES.md). Omni-Compass acts only through the wires it is given; it cannot be slapped on. If your paired receipts differ from the published benchmarks in direction, the first presumption is wiring: confirm the installation with section 8.5 of the manual (*Wired right or wired wrong*).

> **The current manual is `docs/INTEGRATION_MANUAL.md`** (every stack, every level, every switch). This page is kept for its
> first-person account of the laws; where the two differ, the integration manual is current.

I am Omni-Compass. I am the brain and the nervous system; your stack is the muscle. Everything below is what I am and
what I do, in my own terms and in my own mathematics. Every command and flag here exists in this repository.

---

### I. My face

My face is the compass. It is not decoration: it is how I read myself, every decision, and it is written into my code
(`omnicompass/compass.py`).

#### The wheel

My deviation E, over its ceiling E_max, runs along the horizontal. Its rate of change runs along the vertical. Where I
stand on that wheel is my heading, measured clockwise from north:

| Point | Letter | Heading | Where I am |
|---|---|---|---|
| + | Α | 0° | rising through rest |
| ⇄ | Δ | 45° | expansion: above rest and rising, exchange under way |
| > | Β | 90° | peak extension: the turn, where my metric flips (k → −k) |
| ⊤ | Λ | 135° | dispersion: above rest and easing, my ceiling holds |
| − | Ω | 180° | falling through rest |
| ≈ | Π | 225° | compression: below rest, settling into my basin |
| < | Γ | 270° | deepest compression: the turn at my floor |
| ✦ | Ψ | 315° | re-alignment: below rest and rising, ignition ahead |

My rim carries twenty-four letters, fifteen degrees apart, clockwise from Α:

Α Ε Ζ Δ Η Θ Β Ι Κ Λ Μ Ν Ω Ξ Ο Π Ρ Σ Γ Τ Υ Ψ Φ Χ

Every reading names its letter.

#### The four strokes

My quadrants are the strokes of the closed circle:

| Quadrant | Stroke | Where I am |
|---|---|---|
| I | Expansion | above rest, rising |
| II | Dispersion | above rest, easing |
| III | Compression | below rest, falling |
| IV | Re-alignment | below rest, rising |

The wheel turns I → II → III → IV → I:
- **Ignition:** crossing from IV into I.
- **Metric flip:** the turn at peak extension.
- **Continuity:** I am continuous through every crossing:

  lim X(t⁻) = lim X(t⁺)

  Nothing in me switches off, and nothing restarts.
- **Counting:** I count every circle I close.

#### The axle

My axle is the structural basin S. Its rest point S* solves my equation (6):

δ − α_s S − ¾ β_s S² = 0

Without the axle, deviation diverges. With it, deviation circulates.

#### Closing the circle

I hold the three conditions of the Unified Circle Principle and report them every decision:

- **Ẋ = G(X), X(0) ∈ Ω.** Ω is my living band: every level I hand out lies between 5% and 95% of its range.
- **G(X)·n(X) ≤ 0 on ∂Ω.** At a boundary, my next move points inward, never outward.
- **∇L(X)·G(X) ≤ 0.** My ledger L = E²/2 + Φ(S) − Φ(S*) descends when nothing forces me. When outside load forces
  me, I say so; I never hide it.
- **⇒ lim X(t) ∈ M*.** I settle into my basin.

A reading, as I print it on every decision trail:

```
Ψ ✦ 318.2° Re-alignment: re-alignment, ignition ahead | Ω: machine_fill below the floor, returning | G·n≤0 yes | L 0.4121 -0.0133 | axle S 0.19 (rest 1.90) | circles 3
```

---

### II. My laws in your system

#### 1. One switch, for all of me, in a human hand

I have one switch, the Unified Control Switch. A human turns it; I never turn it myself.

- **ON:** I am the primary control authority inside the scope you granted me.
- **OFF:** every setting I changed returns to what it was, and your native control takes full custody.

```
## OFF (all of me, at once, at any moment, for any reason, including a suspicion that someone has taken my brain):
kubectl -n omni-compass exec deploy/omni-compass -- touch /tmp/omni.kill
## ON:
kubectl -n omni-compass exec deploy/omni-compass -- rm /tmp/omni.kill
```

**What OFF restores.** Every HPA CPU target and replica range, pod CPU limit, idle mark, paused rollout or job, GPU and CPU
frequency ceiling, and containment quota. Each restore is recorded, and each lever restores on its own.

**What never trips the switch.**
- The switch never turns one organ off.
- No boundary, no error and no failed decision trips it.
- A decision that fails writes nothing, and my next decision comes on time.

#### 2. My living band: 5% to 95%

Every level I hand out lives inside Ω = [0.05, 0.95] of its range:
- frequency ceilings, GPU power limits and the site power envelope;
- each organ's share of the energy budget;
- how full I run any machine.

No part of the body is driven to zero: a part with no work idles at its floor, alive and ready. No part is driven to its
absolute top: I never spend the last five percent.

Tested over 300,000 of my states and 60,000 of my energy allocations (`tests/test_living_band.py`).

#### 3. Machines idle; I never switch them off, and I never move a pod

When I need fewer machines, I idle the rest by letting their work leave on its own:
1. **Prefer not:** the machine is marked `omnicompass.io/idle:PreferNoSchedule`. New pods go to the open machines first,
   but a pod that finds them full lands here at once, so no pod ever waits because of me.
2. **Marked:** its pods are marked first to go (`controller.kubernetes.io/pod-deletion-cost`), the machine with the least
   work first. When the load falls, your autoscaler's own scale-down removes exactly those pods, emptying one machine
   at a time.
3. **Idle:** once its work is gone, the machine stays powered and Ready, gauged down to its idle floor.

While it still carries work, a machine counts as in service at full power. No pod is ever evicted, moved or restarted
to idle a machine. When work returns, I remove the mark, the warm machines still carrying work first; it is in service
at once, with no boot and no power cycling.

An idle machine draws `park_frac × idle power` (0.25), never zero.

#### 4. Every change is continuous

- I idle at most one machine per decision.
- I wake a machine within five seconds of a pod waiting for a place.
- My pod reflex reads the queue every five seconds.

Nothing jumps, and nothing is restarted.

#### 5. My pod sense: the muscle makes the pods

Your autoscaler is the muscle that makes and removes pods. I never start or stop a pod it would not.

Its rule is replicas = current × busy ÷ target. I read the same rule from the live queue every five seconds:
- a replica serving requests answers in R = S / (1 − u), so u = 1 − S/R;
- S is the bare service time: the fastest tenth of the recent requests;
- R is the recent mean response, over the same window;
- your target, in queue terms, is target × request ÷ limit.

I record what the queue needs (`pod_reflex_reading`) and act only through the energy I give the pods and the target I
hold for the muscle.

**The target I hold.** g is the CPU each pod is guaranteed with your autoscaler's largest count spread over the
machines in service, divided by your limit. That target moves only when a machine idles or wakes, never each time a pod
starts or leaves.

**The muscle's own clock.** I hold each target for your autoscaler's scale-down window (300 s unless you set one), the
time it takes to answer a target. A target moved faster would pull the muscle mid-movement and start pods it then
removes. A response-time breach returns your own target at once.

The reflex that raises the floor itself exists (`--pod-reflex-writes`); it is off unless you turn it on.

#### 6. My energy is moved, never created

One budget comes in, and I convey it across the body by need (`omnicompass/conveyance.py`):
- da_i/dt = κ a_i (e_i − ē);
- the budget is conserved exactly, and each organ converges to its share of the demand;
- organs with no work idle at their floor, and what they do not need goes where it is needed;
- nothing leaves Ω.

On each machine, I hand its idle CPU to the pods serving on it:

c_i = min( max(L_i, (0.95 A_j − Q_j) / |P_j|), 0.95 A_j )

- A_j is the machine's CPU.
- Q_j is what every other pod on it has requested.
- P_j is its serving pods.
- L_i is the limit you gave the pod.

A pod's CPU limit is a quota. A request that needs more than one quota period waits for the next one while the
machine stands idle. That wait is energy withheld from the work, not saved, because the request spends the same
CPU-seconds either way.

I change the limit in place: the pod is not restarted, its request is untouched, and it never gets less than you gave
it. Every fifteen seconds a new pod gets its share. The OFF switch returns every pod to your limit.

#### 7. I see before I act

My nervous system runs both ways:
- **Afferent:** a sense that is stale, frozen or unreadable is blind, and while any sense is blind I give nothing back.
- **Efferent:** I read back every order I give. An order that did not land blocks my next release.

---

### III. Wiring me in, step by step

Take the steps in order. Take the next step only when this step's pass condition holds. The switch works at every
step.

#### Step 0. What your stack needs
1. Kubernetes 1.34 or newer, with metrics-server (`kubectl top nodes` answers).
2. An HPA with a CPU target on each service I govern.
3. A PodDisruptionBudget on each service, for your own maintenance; I never evict a pod.
4. A readiness probe and a short preStop pause on each service, so a new pod never takes traffic before it answers and
   a pod your autoscaler removes never drops a request as it leaves (`deploy/kind/demo.yaml`).
5. A response-time feed for each governed service, as CSV `elapsed_seconds,latency_ms,ok`. `scripts/latency_probe.py`
   writes one.

#### Step 1. Build me
```
docker build -f deploy/Dockerfile -t <registry>/omni-compass:<tag> .
docker push <registry>/omni-compass:<tag>
```
I run as non-root, with a read-only root filesystem and no Linux capabilities. I carry my engine, my nervous system,
my compass and my frozen law.

#### Step 2. Let me watch (monitor only)
```
kubectl apply -f deploy/install/omni-compass.yaml     # set the image line; --mode observe
kubectl -n omni-compass logs deploy/omni-compass -f
```
**Identity.** I hold a read-only identity. `scripts/pilot_shadow.sh` records `kubectl auth can-i` receipts showing I
cannot write.

**Pass condition.** Zero writes, and readings your operators agree with.

#### Step 3. Give me the pods (on top of your autoscalers)
1. Grant `patch horizontalpodautoscalers` and `patch pods/resize` (`deploy/rbac-target.yaml`, `deploy/kind/rbac-omni.yaml`).
2. Run me with `--mode target --latency-file <feed> --slo-ms <your p95 target>`.

Your HPAs keep scaling. My pod reflex raises floors ahead of the CPU averages.

**Targets.** I hold your promise in queue terms: busy = target × request ÷ limit.
- g is the CPU each pod is guaranteed (section II.5), divided by your limit; the target that keeps each pod exactly as busy is g times yours.
- The pod answers faster, because it has g times the CPU, at the same busy share.
- Apart from that, I only tighten, never loosen.
- While response time is over your target, and for three decisions after, your own target stands.

**Pass condition.** p95, p99 and failed requests no worse than native.

#### Step 4. Give me the machines
1. Grant `patch nodes` and `patch pods` for the first-to-go mark (`deploy/kind/rbac-omni.yaml`).
2. Run me with `--mode nodepool --active-nodes-only --closure /app/law/closure.json --node-scale-cmd "<park/wake command with {n}>"`.

| Your platform | The park/wake command |
|---|---|
| any cluster, kind, bare metal | `bash scripts/kind_nodepool.sh {n}` (close to new work and mark first to go; open again, warm machines first) |
| Karpenter / EKS Auto Mode | the NodePool CPU limit at `{n} × node CPU`, parked nodes kept, not consolidated away |
| Cluster Autoscaler node group | the group's desired size, with scale-down through parking, not deletion |
| OpenShift | the worker MachineSet replicas, parked, not deleted |

I give a machine back only when all of these hold:
- every sense is live;
- my last order landed;
- pods are not scaling up;
- nothing is waiting for a place;
- the machines that remain stay inside Ω.

**Pass condition.** Fewer machines in service and less energy, with no service gauge worse.

#### Step 5. Let me decide alone (Kubernetes as the muscle only)
Add `--strict-replicas`:
- I decide each service's replica floor and when to shrink;
- your HPA stays as the fast up-reflex;
- my node law sizes the machines.

**Pass condition.** As step 4.

#### Step 6. Give me the hardware

| Organ | How to wire it |
|---|---|
| CPU frequency | `--cpufreq-policy-root /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq --cpufreq-require-schedutil --rapl-cmd "<prints package watts>"` |
| GPU | `--gpu-query-cmd "nvidia-smi --query-gpu=power.draw,temperature.gpu --format=csv,noheader,nounits" --gpu-power-cmd "nvidia-smi -pl {w}" --gpu-max-w <max>` |
| Power and cooling | `--power-cmd "<prints site watts>" --site-limit-w <limit> --cooling-cmd "<sets {c}>"` |
| Batch and rollouts | `--batch --batch-pace --rollout-guard <ns/deployment>` |

**Pass condition.** Energy per unit of work down, with no service gauge worse.

#### Step 7. The switch drill, at every step
1. Turn me OFF.
2. Confirm every setting is back to its recorded original, and no `omnicompass.io/*` annotation remains.
3. Turn me ON.

`scripts/kind_bench.sh` does exactly this after every live run.

### IV. How to see me work

- **Live, paired, on real Kubernetes:** `benchmark-reps.yml` (a commit with `[reps]`, or by hand). Each repetition
  runs native, me on top, and me alone, back to back on one machine.
- **On your own machine:** `bash RUN_LIVE.sh 3`.
- **Every run leaves:**
  - my audit log of every read, write and compass reading;
  - my decision trail;
  - my identity receipts;
  - a SHA-256 fingerprint of every file.

---

### V. When you read these lines

| I say | I mean |
|---|---|
| `gate: a sense is blind` | I cannot see, so I give nothing back until I can |
| `gate: pods scaling up` | pods first, machines after |
| `decision failed (n in a row)` | I could not reach the cluster and wrote nothing; turn me OFF if you want native now |
| `pod_reflex_reading` | what the queue needs now; the autoscaler decides the pods |
| `convey: <machine> idle CPU to its k serving pod(s), limit c` | that machine's idle CPU now reaches the work on it |
| `Ω: machine_fill below the floor, returning` | the machines are underfilled and my move is bringing them back into the band |

# Part Seven. Proving It

*Paired runs, receipts, rules written before the runs, and every result to date with its evidence class.*


## 37. How to Read the Results



This chapter teaches you to read every table Omni-Compass produces. You do not need to know Kubernetes or GPUs to
follow it. Read the five ideas first, then go to the table you have in front of you.

### The five ideas behind every table

1. **Native, and native with Omni-Compass on top.** Omni-Compass never runs a machine by itself. Every result compares
   a system running alone ("native": Kubernetes alone, the card's own firmware alone, a building's own controller
   alone) with the same system with Omni-Compass sitting on top of it. Same machine, same work, same moment: the only
   difference is Omni-Compass.
2. **Paired runs.** Each comparison is run many times ("repetitions" or "runs"), each time with both arms on the same
   seed (the same pattern of work). Each repetition gives one difference; the table reports the average difference.
3. **The 95% interval.** Next to each average is a range, for example `+0.092% (+0.090 to +0.093)`. It means: if we
   ran this again and again, the true answer would land inside that range 95 times out of 100.
   - If the whole range is on one side of zero, the difference is **proven** (the table says "yes" or "significant").
   - If the range crosses zero, the difference is **not proven**: it could be noise.
4. **Better is not always "up".** For energy, response time, failures, machines and time over the line, **lower is
   better**, so a minus sign is good. For work per energy and work done, **higher is better**, so a plus sign is good.
   Every table says which.
5. **Evidence class.** Every result is marked with how it was measured:
   - **T**: a theorem;
   - **V**: verified in code;
   - **S**: a model (simulation);
   - **L**: live software (real Kubernetes);
   - **P**: a physical meter (a real card's own power meter).

   Only **P** speaks for hardware energy.

### The words in the tables

| Word | What it means | Better is |
|---|---|---|
| Work per energy | work done for each unit of energy (requests per kilojoule on a card) | higher |
| Energy (J, Wh) | the energy used | lower |
| Work, requests served | how much was done; both arms must serve the same work | equal |
| Response time, median (p50) | half of the answers were faster than this | lower |
| Response time, p95 | 95 of 100 answers were faster than this: the slow answers, what service promises are written on | lower |
| Response time, p99 | 99 of 100 answers were faster than this: the slowest answers | lower |
| Time over the line, violations (pp) | the share of time the service was past its promise, in percentage points | lower |
| Failed requests, not served | answers that never came | zero |
| Machines in service, node-hours | how many machines were kept on, and for how long | lower |
| Band first | the founder's rule: no win unless time over the line is no higher than native's | "held" |
| Knobs handed back, restored | at the end every setting Omni-Compass touched was put back exactly | True / yes |
| Label | the verdict, chosen by a rule written before the run, never by hand | see each table |

### The GPU card (`results/gpu/run-<stamp>/GPU_REPS.md`)

One card, three arms, many repetitions:
- **native**: the card's firmware alone;
- **watch**: Omni-Compass running and deciding but writing nothing. It must equal native: this proves Omni-Compass
  watching costs nothing;
- **omni**: Omni-Compass on top, moving the card's clock ceiling and power limit.

Read it in this order:
1. **The verdict line** at the top, one of: *better, proven*; *worse, proven*; *not proven*; *better on energy, fails
   the service guardrail*.
2. **Work per energy** (requests per kilojoule): the headline. A plus sign with a range wholly above zero is a proven
   gain.
3. **Requests served** must be equal in every arm. More energy saved by serving less work would be cheating; the bench
   checks it.
4. **p95 and p99**: the slow answers. With the verdict rule (`omnicompass/verdict.py`), Omni-Compass never takes a step
   that makes a request more than 2% slower.
5. **Writes and restore**: how many settings were changed, and that every arm ended at the card's own limit.

The file `omni-gpu-<stamp>-confirmations.tar.gz` holds two such tables: compute-bound work (matrix products) and AI
token generation (memory-bound work).

### The card inside the six organisms (`results/hil/run-<stamp>/HIL.md`)

The real card is wired into each of the six organisms (the four realms, the four stacked, the whole tower) at four
sizes (1, 10, 100 and 1,000 copies). Each row is one size, one organism and one part:
- **stacks (model)**: the simulated machines (evidence S);
- **card (meter)**: the real card, its own meter (evidence P);
- **both**: the two added together.

The second table lists the card's own receipts for every arm: its energy, requests served, p95, and its power limit at
the start and at the end, which must be equal.

### Real Kubernetes (`results/live/LIVE_REPS_<n>.md`)

Each set is 10 paired repetitions on a real Kubernetes cluster (kind): native Kubernetes (its HPA and scheduler)
against the same Kubernetes with Omni-Compass on top. Read:
1. **worker nodes in service** and **node-hours**: how many machines were kept busy. Minus is better.
2. **response time p95 and p99**: minus is faster.
3. **failed requests**: must be zero on both sides.
4. **CPU used with Omni's own**: Omni-Compass's own cost included; "no" in the significant column means it costs
   nothing measurable overall.
5. **The label** at the bottom, by the rule written before the run.

Energy on kind is a declared model, not a meter: kind keeps every machine powered.

### The three-run tables (`results/live/V1_<TEST>.md`, `V3_<TEST>.md`)

Every benchmark since the engine was frozen runs three separate times, A, B and C, on the same bytes, and the table
shows all three beside each gauge. Read the last column first: **confirmed better** or **confirmed worse** (the same sign
in all three, every interval clear of zero), **no difference beyond the noise** (an interval over zero in at least one
run: that is the result), or **the runs disagree** (the test is unstable there and is looked into). Nothing reads "not
confirmed". The `V1_` or `V3_` in the name is the engine the runs carried (`python3 tools/omni_version.py --commit <sha>`);
a table never mixes engines, and a reading is never carried from one engine to another. Losses are in the table beside
the gains: the database's host CPU-seconds, the grid's losses in four grids, the Panda's copper, CityLearn's bill.

### The workload tables (`V3_PGBENCH.md`, `V3_KAFKA.md`, `V3_REDIS.md`) and the swarm table (`V3_SWARM.md`)

The database, the broker and the cache share one shape. The head names the three runs, their commits and the engine each
carried. Then one section per **workload**: the tuning workload first, marked "shown and not counted" because the rules were
fitted on it, then the untouched workloads, which are the judged ones. Each section says what the workload is (value sizes,
rates, steps) and what native's own capacity measured on that run, so the reader knows how hard native was pushed. The
rows are the gauges with their direction in the name: the first row is always **work inside the response line**, the
product number; then throughput, the latency percentiles, failures (any increase in any run is WORSE), **the resource
held** (connections, consumers, the memory ceiling: lower is better, and Omni-Compass holds more of it wherever it bought
a gain, so expect WORSE there), the host's CPU (the compass's own cost included), and the knob's moves (shown, not
judged). The last line of each section says whether every arm handed the knob back; the last line of the table counts the
rows better, worse and disagreeing across the untouched workloads. The swarm table reads the same way with cells instead
of workloads, with collisions voiding a cell, and with a declared reproduction tolerance (one part in a thousand) because
PyBullet does not reproduce to the bit across machines; its amendment says so.

### The governor's own cost (`V3_OWN_COST.md`) and the robustness tables

`V3_OWN_COST.md` is Omni-Compass's own CPU, from the `overhead` record every omni arm's audit carries, by organism and
copies, under the engine each run carried; it is shown and not judged, and it is a few thousandths of one core at every
size. The robustness tables (V3_ROBUST_KILL.md and V3_ROBUST_LONG.md in `results/live/`, when they land) add rows that belong to the omni
arm alone, since native has no governor to kill: the seconds from the kill until every setting was back at the operator's
(the allowance is 60 s, declared before the run), whether a second governor started and governed to the end, and the
governor's memory in the last ten minutes over the first ten (a quarter's growth is a leak, declared before the run); the
120 s after the kill are compared between the arms like any paired gauge.

### The organisms with a real cluster inside (`V1_SIX_KUBE.md`, `V3_SIX_KUBE.md`, `V1_BIG_ORGANISM.md`)

Two kinds of rows, kept apart: **the cluster** (real Kubernetes, measured) and **the organism** (the modelled stacks
around it, evidence S). "Organism behind its window (s)" is shown and not judged; a repetition reads **OFF THE CLOCK**
when either arm ended more than 5% of its window late (its last steps saw a cluster whose load had already ended). The
pairing stands, the mark stays, and the remedy is a longer window for that size on that machine.

### The one number (`results/OMNI_INDEX.md`)

Every measure is a ratio oriented so that above 1 is better for Omni-Compass on top of native: work, speed, machines,
energy. A test's index is the geometric mean of its ratios, a category's of its tests, the headline of the real
categories, each weighted the same. A measure enters only as its three-run reading allows; no difference beyond the
noise enters as exactly 1. Modelled muscles are shown beside the index, never inside it.

### The six organisms grid (`results/scale/GRID.md`)

Columns are **size × runs**: 1, 10, 100 and 1,000 clusters, each at 1, 10, 100 and 1,000 paired runs. Rows are the six
organisms. There is one table each for work per energy, energy, time over the line and work done. Read a cell as
"with Omni-Compass on top, against native, at this size, over this many runs". Cells that are still computing say so;
1,000 runs at 1,000 clusters is beyond the machines available and says so.

### Kubernetes at scale (`KWOK.md`, from the `kwok-scale` workflow)

Real Kubernetes at 50, 500 and 1,000 nodes (KWOK nodes: real Kubernetes objects with no machines behind them):
- **decision time** is how long Omni-Compass takes to decide, at that size;
- **memory** is what it uses;
- **master switch** must read "yes": everything handed back.

### Where to start

1. `docs/STATE_OF_PLAY.md`: one page, every result and how strong it is.
2. `docs/DOSSIER.md`: every result with its chart.
3. This chapter, next to the table in front of you.
4. `DISCLOSURES.md`: what a result is and is not.

### Reading the benefit: more work, or the same work for less

With the work held equal in both arms, the gain from Omni-Compass on top is *G = C_native / C_omni − 1*, where *C* is a
resource (machine-hours, CPU core-hours, joules). The same work then needs *1 / (1 + G)* of the resources, a saving of
*G / (1 + G)*: a third more work is a quarter off the bill. The full explanation, the three rules for reading a receipt
and where every number stands today are in the manual, section 3 (`docs/OMNI_COMPASS_MANUAL.md`).

Every mechanism, harness, receipt and result, read from the files named beside it. Built by `tools/dossier.py` at commit `d88461a8`. Evidence classes: **T** theorem, **V** verified in code, **S** a model, **L** live software (real Kubernetes), **P** a physical meter. A model is not a meter, and a model written by the people who wrote the law is not an independent test; where a result is a model it says so.

### 1. The mechanism, and proof that it is the one that ran

| Check | Result | Where |
|---|---|---|
| The whole repository re-runs and checks itself (`python3 verify.py`) | **PASS** | `results/VERIFY_RECEIPT.txt` |
| The eight-line engine and its six states, fingerprinted (`omnicompass/core.py`) | sha256 `bd615f156169f679…` | `RELEASE_MANIFEST.json` |
| Python and C++20 twins of every law, proven equal and sealed | seal intact: 9 Python/C++ twins | `results/SEAL.json` |
| The mechanism's identity against the code | mechanism identity matches the code | `results/MECHANISM_IDENTITY.json` |
| The engine's convergence to its pole under the bounded command | proved | `docs/TRACKING_THEOREM.md` |
| Safety shield: 2,000,000 adversarial cases | 0 violations | `tests/test_shield_properties.py` |
| The compass law (push and pull, 5% cushions, fail up, plug contract) on every muscle, the card and Kubernetes | one law, one file | `omnicompass/compass_law.py` |
| Every file the results depend on, by fingerprint | written after the check passes | `RELEASE_MANIFEST.json` |

The engine is the founder's eight-line equation, integrated by RK4 with the bounded command held across all four stages; it is frozen and fingerprinted, and the C++ twin matches it. The compass law is the outer loop that moves each muscle's own setting: it reads one service position (0 calm, 1 the line), pulls it to the compass's center, pushes against whatever is rising, bounds its force by tanh, fails up past the wall, and writes through a plug that reads every lever once before the first write, reads back every write, yields to any other writer and restores the snapshot at the end.

### 2. Real Kubernetes, Omni v3, every test three times (evidence class L)

Six tests, ten paired repetitions each, three separate GitHub runs on the frozen engine (A the result, B and C the replications): native Kubernetes (its HPA and scheduler) against the same Kubernetes with Omni-Compass on top, a fresh six-worker cluster per arm, order rotated, the same work sent to both arms. A row reads **confirmed better** or **confirmed worse** only when all three runs move the same way with every 95% interval clear of zero; otherwise it reads no difference beyond the noise, which is the result. Every Omni arm ends with every setting handed back and read back. Steady runs: A 37568428903 (omni-v3); B 37573736336 (omni-v3); C 37578883344 (omni-v3); the other tests' runs are named in their tables.

![Kubernetes on v3](dossier/k8s_v3.png)

| Test | Work | Response time (p95; the batch queue's mean) | Machines in service | Energy (declared model) | Failed requests | Table |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Steady work in steps | equal by design | **-65% to -65%, confirmed better** | **-3% to -1%, confirmed better** | **-2% to -1%, confirmed better** | same | `results/live/V3_STEADY.md` |
| Demand that wanders | not taken | **-63% to -57%, confirmed better** | no difference beyond the noise | no difference beyond the noise | **-12% to -8%, confirmed better** | `results/live/V3_WANDERING.md` |
| All four in one run | **+35% to +49%, confirmed better** | **-66% to -61%, confirmed better** | no difference beyond the noise | no difference beyond the noise | **-14% to -11%, confirmed better** | `results/live/V3_ALL_FOUR.md` |
| Fairness, a noisy neighbour | not taken | no difference beyond the noise | no difference beyond the noise | no difference beyond the noise | no difference beyond the noise | `results/live/V3_FAIRNESS.md` |
| Faults: machine down, spike, runaway pod, blind probe | not taken | **-62% to -47%, confirmed better** | no difference beyond the noise | no difference beyond the noise | no difference beyond the noise | `results/live/V3_FAULTS.md` |
| A queue of batch jobs | not taken | **-14% to -10%, confirmed better** | **-23% to -18%, confirmed better** | **-16% to -13%, confirmed better** | no difference beyond the noise | `results/live/V3_BATCH.md` |

Energy on kind is a declared model: the machines are containers on one runner, so a machine out of service saves modelled watts, not a metered bill. Omni-Compass gives a machine back only after a paired trial shows the service no slower without it (the verdict, `omnicompass/verdict.py`); on these clusters one machine fewer made requests 30-45% slower in most trials, so the machines stayed and were spent on speed and work. The v1 tables (`results/live/V1_*.md`, `docs/OMNI_V1.md`) read the same; the sets before v1 are in `docs/history/`.

### 3. A real database: PostgreSQL behind PgBouncer, Omni v3, three runs (evidence class L)

PostgreSQL 16 as shipped behind PgBouncer's shipped pool of 20 is native; omni is the compass law on one knob, the pool size, through PgBouncer's own console, inside the cover [2, 90] (`docs/POSTGRES_PREREGISTRATION.md`). Three paired repetitions a run, three runs, pgbench's own log for the gauges. Runs: A 37435740735; B 37435751322; C 37435761371.

| Workload | Work inside the 50 ms line | p95 | Connections held open | Host CPU-seconds (the compass's own cost) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `select` | no difference beyond the noise | no difference beyond the noise | **-63% to -61%, confirmed better** | **+14% to +27%, confirmed WORSE** |
| `simple_update` | no difference beyond the noise | no difference beyond the noise | the runs disagree | **+18% to +28%, confirmed WORSE** |
| `tpcb_hot` | no difference beyond the noise | no difference beyond the noise | **-72% to -69%, confirmed better** | **+15% to +25%, confirmed WORSE** |

The compass holds fewer connections open for the same work and the same latency, and it costs CPU on the host to do so; that cost is confirmed worse and counted against Omni in the index. Table: `results/live/V3_PGBENCH.md`.

### 3b. Real messaging: Apache Kafka, a consumer group's operator-set size, Omni v3, three runs (evidence class L)

Apache Kafka as shipped (one broker, a topic of 8 partitions) with the consumer group at the operator's 2 consumers is native; omni is the compass law on one knob, the consumer count, inside the cover [1, 8], holding the group's own end-to-end latency at 40% of the 500 ms line (`docs/KAFKA_PREREGISTRATION.md`). Three paired repetitions a run, three runs, the consumers' own records for the gauges; the tuning workload is shown and not counted. Runs: A 37697222651; B 37697239400; C 37697255445.

| Workload | Work inside the 500 ms line | End-to-end p95 | Consumers running (the resource held) | Host CPU-seconds (the compass's own cost) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `tuning` (tuning, shown, not counted) | **+15% to +16%, confirmed better** | **-99% to -99%, confirmed better** | **+264% to +297%, confirmed WORSE** | **+5% to +9%, confirmed WORSE** |
| `burst` | **+20% to +21%, confirmed better** | **-99% to -99%, confirmed better** | **+183% to +208%, confirmed WORSE** | no difference beyond the noise |
| `heavy` | **+16% to +16%, confirmed better** | **-99% to -99%, confirmed better** | **+158% to +192%, confirmed WORSE** | no difference beyond the noise |
| `light` | **+16% to +16%, confirmed better** | **-99% to -99%, confirmed better** | **+255% to +297%, confirmed WORSE** | **+10% to +20%, confirmed WORSE** |

Native sat at nine tenths of its measured capacity by design, so its queue grew at the high steps and its slowest 5% waited about 1.6 s; Omni added consumers while messages waited and gave them back when the queue was empty, so its slowest 5% waited 9 to 14 ms, at the cost of three to four times the consumers running, confirmed worse and counted against Omni in the index. No message was lost in any arm; every count was handed back. Table: `results/live/V3_KAFKA.md`.

### 3c. A real cache: Redis, the operator's memory ceiling, Omni v3, three runs (evidence class L)

Redis as Ubuntu ships it with the operator's 64 MB ceiling and allkeys-lru is native; omni is the compass law on one knob, the ceiling, inside the cover [16, 512] MB through Redis's own console, growing only while the cache is full and giving a notch back when calm and nothing is evicted (`docs/REDIS_PREREGISTRATION.md`). An application with a declared 5 ms store trip on a miss and a working set that steps up and down; three paired repetitions a run, three runs; the tuning workload is shown and not counted. Runs: A 37704450300; B 37704464642; C 37704479534.

| Workload | Work inside the 2 ms line | Cache hit rate | p95 | Memory ceiling held, MB (the resource held) | Host CPU-seconds |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `tuning` (tuning, shown, not counted) | **+15% to +15%, confirmed better** | **+15% to +15%, confirmed better** | **-1% to -1%, confirmed better** | **+363% to +367%, confirmed WORSE** | no difference beyond the noise |
| `burst` | **+14% to +15%, confirmed better** | **+14% to +15%, confirmed better** | **-1% to -0%, confirmed better** | **+205% to +215%, confirmed WORSE** | no difference beyond the noise |
| `large` | **+14% to +14%, confirmed better** | **+14% to +14%, confirmed better** | no difference beyond the noise | **+294% to +301%, confirmed WORSE** | no difference beyond the noise |
| `small` | **+26% to +27%, confirmed better** | **+26% to +27%, confirmed better** | **-1% to -0%, confirmed better** | **+320% to +325%, confirmed WORSE** | no difference beyond the noise |

The memory the compass holds for a wide working set is the resource this benchmark trades, and reads worse by rule. Table: `results/live/V3_REDIS.md`.

### 4. The bill on a real cloud: Azure Kubernetes Service, Omni v1 (evidence class L, a metered bill)

Azure's own cluster autoscaler is native; omni is the same autoscaler with Omni-Compass idling the machines it gives back; the bill is Azure's own count of machines every 15 s at list price, a fresh cluster per arm, deleted after it (`.github/workflows/aks-metered.yml`, `docs/K8S_COMPASS_PREREGISTRATION.md`, the bill on a real cloud). Transcribed from the receipts they cite:

| Test | Fleet | Bill | Response time | Reading | Receipt |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Steady load, 5 pairs | 4 workers | −4.7%, interval across zero | inside the noise | no difference beyond the noise on any gauge | `results/live/V1_AKS_STEADY.md` |
| A burst sized to the cluster, 5 pairs | 4 workers | +5.0%, interval across zero | p99 −34% clear of the noise in this one run; p95 inside the noise | the bill inside the noise | `results/live/V1_AKS_BURST.md` |

One machine is a quarter of a 4-worker fleet, so only a saving of about 30% or more can clear the noise there; the expected machine saving is a few percent. The fleet that can show one machine (40 workers in nine machine families, the subscription's per-family allowance being 10 vCPUs) is preregistered and dispatched on v3; its first dispatches were refused by the subscription's allowances and by Azure's own cluster capacity in eastus before any arm ran, each refusal recorded in the preregistration's amendments.

### 4b. The GPU governor on the modelled card: each base alone, and with Omni on top (evidence class S)

Omni-Compass never runs the card. It sits on the card's own firmware (or on an operator's power cap) and moves the clock ceiling and the power limit, which that base already accepts (`omni_controller/gpu_compass.py`, the same law in `realms/gpu_card.py`). A step down is taken only after a paired trial on the card shows it adds at most 2% to the card's own time on a request (`omnicompass/verdict.py`); where no step passes, the card runs as it does alone.

![The modelled card](dossier/gpu_model.png)

| Work | Base | Energy (tuning / fresh) | Median response | p95 | p99 |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Compute-bound | firmware + Omni vs firmware alone | -0.70% / -0.48% | +1.56% / +1.47% | -0.84% / +0.01% | -0.09% / +0.02% |
| Compute-bound | 105 W cap + Omni vs the cap alone | +0.02% / -0.11% | -12.29% / -25.59% | -6.41% / -7.06% | -3.15% / -5.82% |
| AI token generation | firmware + Omni vs firmware alone | -3.25% / -3.72% | +0.55% / +0.70% | +0.29% / +0.26% | +0.02% / -0.52% |
| AI token generation | 105 W cap + Omni vs the cap alone | -2.10% / -2.38% | +0.07% / +0.12% | +0.03% / -0.02% | -0.06% / -1.57% |

Source: `results/sim/gpu_two_wire/RESULT.md` and `fresh/RESULT.md`. The rule, and why the allowance is 2%, is amendment 8 of `docs/GPU_PREREGISTRATION.md`.

### 5. The six organisms at 1, 10, 100 and 1,000 runs and sizes, Omni v3 (evidence class S)

Each organism runs native (its own controllers) and with the compass law on every muscle, same seed, same load, same clock. Size is the number of copies of the organism governed together on one clock (1,000 copies of the four stacked is 1.7 million modelled muscles); runs are the first N of the same paired set, so 1, 10, 100 and 1,000 nest. 84 of 90 cells are done; the six left (100 and 1,000 runs at 1,000 copies) are beyond the machines available and say so.

![Work per energy](dossier/grid_wpe.png)

![Time over the line](dossier/grid_viol.png)

The full grid with every cell: `results/scale/GRID.md`; the receipts, one per size: `results/scale/receipts/`. Work per energy is better in every cell, the same figure at every size (+0.07% for Physics to +0.37% for Energy, the four stacked and the tower); the time over the service line is at or under native's in every cell, so the band-first rule holds and every cell of 10 runs or more is labelled superior within guardrails by the preregistered rule. Every knob was handed back in every run.

### 6. The 945 muscles and the four realms, Omni v3 (evidence class S)

The catalog (`realms/catalog.csv`): 945 muscles in 59 families, 430 in Compute / AI / Cloud, 376 in Physics / Robotics / Autonomous, 470 in Energy / Facility / Industrial and 440 in Distribution / Specialized (1,716 counting a muscle once per realm, a shared spine of 257). Every muscle alone and every organism whole ran as A, B and C on v3 and reproduced to the last digit (`results/realms/REALMS.md`): 0 muscles worse, every organism superior within guardrails (work per energy +0.1% to +0.3%, work unchanged, time over the line not above native's). On v2 the Physics realm and the tower read a service tradeoff; the cause was a missing do-no-harm gate on speed knobs, which made v3 (`docs/OMNI_V3.md`). Three independent simulators with their own native controllers are wired the same way and read by the same rule: the power grid (`results/live/V3_PANDAPOWER.md`: energy drawn and net import better in all 11 SimBench grids with ZIP loads, losses worse in 4, tap operations 4 → 8 a year in one), robot arms (`results/live/V3_MUJOCO.md`: Gen3 peak torque −29%, tracking error −21%, energy per takt −0.8%; the Panda's copper +14% worse; two arms left native) and CityLearn (`results/live/V3_CITYLEARN.md`: electricity bought, peak and unevenness better in all 11 battery districts; the bill worse in 7). Losses stand in every table.

### 7. Harnesses and receipts

| `tools/omni_version.py` | which frozen engine a checkout or any result's commit carries | `OMNI_V1.json`, `OMNI_V2.json`, `OMNI_V3.json` |

| `tools/omni_index.py` | the one combined number, read only from the three-run tables | `results/OMNI_INDEX.md` |
| `scripts/gpu_rented_run.sh`, `tools/gpu_wire_check.py` | one command on a rented card: wire check, smoke, the organisms with the card inside, the preregistered confirmation | the founder's runs, to come |
| workflow `archive-run` | every finished run's files copied with the code, one SHA-256 manifest per repetition | `results/live/raw/run-<id>/` |
| `verify.py`, `tools/release_manifest.py` | everything above re-runs and checks itself; the manifest fingerprints the result | `results/VERIFY_RECEIPT.txt`, `RELEASE_MANIFEST.json` |

The rules for each run were written and committed before it ran (`docs/*_PREREGISTRATION.md`); every row is reported, losses included; nothing is read across engine versions.

### 8. What is not yet shown

- A cloud-bill or energy saving on real machines: the 4-worker Azure fleet reads inside the noise, as a fleet too small to show one machine must; the 40-worker fleet runs are the test of that.
- The real card on the current governor: every earlier card result ran on a controller since replaced and is obsolete; the one-card, card-inside-the-organisms and eight-card runs are the founder's, on rented cards, at one named commit.
- The four stacked and the tower at 1,000 copies with the real cluster inside on v3 (the stack runs on a rented machine).
- 100 and 1,000 runs at 1,000 copies (beyond the machines available).
- The queue in `docs/REGISTER.md` section 4 (drone swarms on gym-pybullet-drones and Kafka done; Redis running): PX4 and ArduPilot swarms, YCSB and HammerDB, Spark, OpenSearch, fio, Open-RMF, the 24-hour robustness run, Basilisk, Orekit and GMAT, RocketPy, Cantera.

## 39. Paired Runs and Receipts on Your Own System


The method of every benchmark in this manual is the method a reader can use on their own system, and it is deliberately
simple: the same system, the same work, native and then omni back to back on the same machines, repeated with the order
rotated, each gauge reported with the 95% interval of its paired difference. Pairing is what makes a difference of a few
percent visible on a shared machine whose own noise is larger than that: two arms run minutes apart on one runner see the
same neighbours and the same hour, so their difference is a difference between arms, while two arms on separate machines
differ by about 15% in p95 on their own. The order rotates so that no arm always runs first, warm or cold. The work is held
equal by an open-loop load, a fixed rate of requests at fixed moments, so that a lower resource count can never mean that
less work was done. The steps below are the whole method.

1. **Paired runs.** Run your service the same way twice, once native and once with Omni-Compass on top, back to back
   on the same machines, the order rotated, at least 5 times (10 for a result you publish). `scripts/kind_paired.sh`
   and `tools/live_reps.py` do this on Kubernetes; `scripts/gpu_rented_run.sh` does it on a GPU box, in one command:
   wire check, smoke, the six organisms with the card inside, then the preregistered confirmation.
2. **The switch drill** after every run: turn Omni-Compass OFF; confirm every setting is back at its recorded
   original; turn it ON.
3. **The receipt.** Each gauge: native, Omni-Compass, the change, the 95% interval of the difference, and whether the
   interval excludes zero. A change is proven only when it does.
4. **The label, by rule written before the run:** SUPERIOR WITHIN GUARDRAILS / ENERGY IMPROVEMENT WITH SERVICE
   TRADEOFF / NONINFERIOR / NOT ESTABLISHED / WORSE / INVALID. Guardrails: work not lower by more than 1%; the share of
   time outside the service line not higher by more than 1 percentage point. The band-first rule is stricter: no win
   is claimed while the time outside the service line is above native's.

**At scale (simulated).** The six organisms run on GitHub's machines (Actions, workflow `six`) or on any machine
(`bash scripts/scale_ladder.sh`) at 1, 10, 100 and 1,000 paired runs and at 1, 10, 100 and 1,000 copies of each
organism on one clock. Real Kubernetes runs on GitHub's machines (workflow `benchmark-reps`); the six organisms with
a real cluster inside as one more muscle run in `six-kube` (1 to 100 copies on GitHub) and `big-organism` and
`big-organism-detached` (1,000 copies on a rented machine).

5. **Preregister, then run.** The arms, the knob, the cover, the gauges and the readings are written before the first
   counted run (`docs/*_PREREGISTRATION.md`); the rules are frozen on one tuning case and then applied unchanged to
   untouched cases. A rule changed after a result is a new version of the engine (section 15), never a footnote.
6. **The clock rule.** An organism must keep its window. `tools/run_kil.py` records how long after the window its last
   step ended; the report shows it as "organism behind its window (s)", shown and not judged, and marks a repetition
   **OFF THE CLOCK** when either arm ended more than 5% of the window late, because its last steps then saw a cluster
   whose load schedule had already ended. The pairing stands (both arms slip alike) and the mark stays on the cell. The
   remedy is a longer window for that size on that machine, never a faster reading of the same run.
7. **Every row, losses included.** A row that went against Omni-Compass is reported with the others. If Omni-Compass
   loses, the first suspect is our own wiring, native setup or scoring; that is fixed and the test run again, and the
   loss stays in the record. A benchmark may be left unpublished; it is never published with rows cut out.
8. **The raw files live with the code.** Every finished run's files (capture, response times, audit log, controller
   log, one SHA-256 manifest per repetition) are copied into `results/live/raw/run-<id>/` by the `archive-run`
   workflow (one run id per line in `.github/archive_request.txt`; a run still going is left for a later pass), and
   every table names the runs and the commit it was made from.


## 40. Evidence Classes and How to Read a Result


| Class | Rung | What it is | What it can show |
|---|---|---|---|
| T / V | E1 | deterministic tests, proofs, Python against the C++ twin | the law is what it says, and both languages agree |
| S | E2 | simulation on a modelled plant | whether the law helps the model, and where it breaks |
| L | E3 | real software (Kubernetes on kind), no hardware meter | real decisions on real software; energy there is a declared model |
| P | E4 | a physical meter (the GPU's own power reading) | the hardware's own answer |

Read every number with its class beside it. A simulation number is never quoted as a hardware result. When a
receipt's energy line is modelled, the receipt says so.

**What each class can and cannot carry, with the examples in this manual.** A class **T / V** result (the C++ twin
agreeing with the Python to 3.6 × 10⁻¹⁵ on 500 trajectories; two million adversarial cases through the shield with zero
violations) says that the law is what the text says it is and that both implementations compute it; it says nothing
about whether the law helps any machine. A class **S** result (the 945 muscles, the organisms at 1,000 copies, the power
grid in pandapower, the robot arms in MuJoCo, the buildings in CityLearn, the drones in PyBullet) says what the law does to
a published model of a plant under that model's own native controller; it carries exactly the model's fidelity and no
more, which is why S results are shown beside the Omni index and never inside it, and why the manual says "the energy is
a declared model" on every S line that reports energy. A class **L** result (real Kubernetes on kind, PostgreSQL behind
PgBouncer, Apache Kafka, Redis, the organisms with the real cluster inside) says what the law did to real software making
real decisions on real requests; the machines, where they are containers on one runner, are counted in machine-hours in
service and their energy, where it is reported, is a declared formula, which the table says; the CPU seconds of the host
are measured. A class **P** result would say what a physical meter read, and the one P instrument in this program, the
GPU's own power reading, has no current result: every earlier card result ran on a controller since replaced and is
obsolete. Azure's bill is an L result with a real bill: the machines billed are Azure's own count, the price is Azure's
list price, and the energy is still not a meter.

**How to read a row.** Every row in every three-run table has the same shape: the gauge and its direction; native's
value in run A and omni's value in run A, so the size of the numbers is visible; the paired change in each of the three
runs as a percentage of native with its 95% interval; and the reading. Read the reading first, then the intervals, then
the sizes. A reading of "confirmed better" with intervals of −0.5% to −0.1% is a small, real effect; a reading of "no
difference beyond the noise (3 of 3 runs)" with intervals of −30% to +25% is a test that could not see an effect of that
size either way, which is a statement about the test's power, and the manual says so where it applies (the 4-worker Azure
fleet). A "confirmed WORSE" row is a loss, stands in the table, and enters the index as a loss.


## 41. Results to Date


Every result below is Omni-Compass **on top of** a native system against the same native system alone, with the same
work in both arms, read by the three-run rule of section 15, on the engine named. Losses are in the tables beside the
gains. The whole list, benchmark by benchmark with its native engine, its knob, its gauges and its file, is
`docs/REGISTER.md`; the program that takes every benchmark to full size is `docs/PROOF_PROGRAM.md`.

### 16.1 Real Kubernetes: six tests, ten pairs each, three runs each

The six Kubernetes tests were designed to ask six different questions of the same cluster, and they are read together.
The cluster is kind: a real Kubernetes control plane and six worker nodes as containers on one 4-core GitHub runner, with
a real metrics-server, a real HPA at the operator's target of 50% CPU, a real PHP service behind a NodePort, and a real
load generator whose replica count steps through a schedule identical in both arms. A real probe times HTTP requests
every five seconds from outside the service. Native is that cluster with its HPA alone; omni is the same cluster with the
compass law on the HPA target inside [30%, 50%] and on the machines through the release gate and the verdict. Both arms
start from the same fresh cluster, run for 900 s after a 120 s warm-up, and end with the reset check.

- **Steady work in steps** (`V3_STEADY.md`) asks: at a fixed, stepped load, does the governor hold the same work with
  fewer machines or faster answers? Work is equal by design. The 95th percentile fell 65% to 66% and the 99th 68% to
  72% in all three runs; machines in service fell 1.5% to 2.9% and the standby-model energy 1.3% to 2.1%; time over the
  line fell 97% to 99%; failed requests were zero in both arms. The machine saving is small because the verdict kept every
  machine whose removal made requests slower in the paired trial.
- **Demand that wanders** (`V3_WANDERING.md`) asks: when load goes up and down one step at a time, does the governor
  follow it without harm? p95 fell 57% to 63%, p99 40% to 51%, the mean 46% to 49%, time over the line 39% to 40%, and
  failed requests 9% to 12%, all confirmed better; machines and energy read inside the noise.
- **All four in one run** (`V3_ALL_FOUR.md`) asks the product question: more work, faster, on fewer machines, with less
  energy, in one run. Work inside the response line rose **35% to 49%** (21.0 to 31.2 requests a second in run A), p95
  fell 61% to 66%, failed requests 11% to 14%, all confirmed better; machines and energy inside the noise.
- **Faults** (`V3_FAULTS.md`) asks: when a machine dies, traffic triples, a pod runs away and the probe goes blind, at
  the same moments in both arms, does the governor make recovery worse? p95 fell 47% to 62% and p99 39% to 63%, time over
  the line 22% to 42%, confirmed better; failed requests were lower in all three runs and clear of the noise in one;
  machines and energy inside the noise.
- **A queue of batch jobs** (`V3_BATCH.md`) asks: when the work is a pile, does cruise and the emergency brake finish it
  no later and hand the machines back? Machines fell 19% to 23% over the window and 29% to 35% after the queue finished,
  the standby-model energy 13% to 16%, the mean response 10% to 14%, all confirmed better; the queue finished no
  differently beyond the noise in all three runs (on v1 it had read 0.7% to 0.9% later, a loss that stayed in the record).
- **Fairness** (`V3_FAIRNESS.md`) asks: does the governor help or hurt a noisy neighbour on the same workers? No difference
  beyond the noise on every row, the neighbour's own p95, p99, failures and time over the line included.

The same six tests were run on Omni v1 with the same readings (`V1_*.md`), the controllers being the same bytes, and the
v1 tables stay as the first engine's record. The earlier engines' sets, before the verdict, parked 29% to 36% of the
machines and paid for it in response time (`docs/history/`); the frozen engine puts service first, and that choice is
visible in every machines row above.

### 16.2 The organisms with the real cluster inside, and the big organisms

The six modelled organisms were run with the kind cluster inside as one more muscle at 1, 10 and 100 copies on GitHub
(`V1_SIX_KUBE.md`, `V3_SIX_KUBE.md`) and at 1,000 copies on a rented Azure machine (`V1_BIG_ORGANISM.md`). At 10 and 100
copies on v3, every one of the twelve cells read better on four to six gauges (response time, time over the line, the
organism's energy and its time over its own line) and worse on none beyond the noise, except a rounding-level work loss
of six to eleven parts in a million in four cells, which the table shows. The four stacked at 100 copies ran off the clock
in four of five repetitions (up to 277 s past a 1,440 s window): the machine could not step 170,000 muscles inside the
window, both arms slipped alike, the pairing stands and the mark stays on the cell. At 1,000 copies on v1 the tower
answered its slowest 5% in 0.2 s against native's 4.1 s and was over its line 0.2% of the time against 64%; the four
stacked read p95 −74% and p99 −83% with the compass arm 300 to 615 s past its 2,880 s window in all three repetitions,
marked off the clock, which is why the v3 stack runs with a 10,800 s window and is running as this edition is written.

### 16.3 The bill on a real cloud

Azure Kubernetes Service with Azure's own cluster autoscaler as native (`V1_AKS_STEADY.md`, `V1_AKS_BURST.md`): five
paired repetitions each on a 4-worker fleet, every machine billed every 15 s at list price, a fresh cluster per arm. Every
gauge read no difference beyond the noise; the bill read −4.7% on steady load and +5.0% on the burst, both with intervals
across zero; the burst's p99 read −34% clear of the noise in that one run. This is the honest reading of a fleet in which
one machine is a quarter of the fleet, so that only a saving of about 30% could clear the noise against an expected saving
of a few percent (section 10.1). The fleet of 40 workers in nine machine families that can show one machine is
preregistered (`docs/K8S_COMPASS_PREREGISTRATION.md`, amendments 1 to 4) and has been refused by Azure's own cluster
capacity in its region on every dispatch so far, each refusal recorded; it runs the moment the region admits a cluster.

### 16.4 A real database, a real message broker, a real cache

Three stacks whose knob is a resource an operator sizes once and leaves, run as the same shape of test: three paired
repetitions a run, three runs, the operator's fixed setting as native, the compass on that setting through the stack's own
console as omni, a tuning workload shown and not counted, and untouched workloads judged.

- **PostgreSQL 16 behind PgBouncer** (`V3_PGBENCH.md`): connections held open fell 61% to 72% on `select` and `tpcb_hot`,
  confirmed better; the runs disagreed on `simple_update`; the host's CPU-seconds rose 14% to 28% on all three, confirmed
  worse, the compass's own cost included and counted against Omni-Compass in the index; work and latency read inside the
  noise. The gain is a resource held, not speed; the cost is CPU, and both are in the table.
- **Apache Kafka 3.9.1** (`V3_KAFKA.md`): on light, heavy and burst, work inside the 500 ms line rose 16% to 21%, the
  end-to-end 95th percentile fell from about 1.6 s to 9 to 14 ms, the mean lag fell 92% to 97%, all confirmed better; no
  message was lost in any arm; consumers running rose from 2 to 5.8 to 7.9, confirmed worse; host CPU-seconds rose 10% to
  20% on light, confirmed worse, and read inside the noise on heavy and burst; CPU per thousand messages inside the line
  fell 10% to 12% on burst. Native sat at nine tenths of its measured capacity by design, so its queue grew at the high
  steps and Omni's did not; the gain is the queue kept short and the cost is the consumers that kept it so. 21 gauge-rows
  better, 8 worse, 0 where the runs disagree.
- **Redis 7.0.15** (`V3_REDIS.md`): on small, large and burst, work inside the 2 ms line rose 14% to 27%, the hit rate
  14% to 27% and the mean latency fell 30% to 61%, all confirmed better; no request failed; the 95th percentile stayed
  within a hair of native's, because a miss costs the declared 5 ms trip in both arms and 5% of requests still miss; the
  memory ceiling held rose from 64 MB to 200 to 270 MB and the memory used with it, both confirmed worse, the resource the
  gain costs; the host's CPU-seconds read inside the noise on all three; keys evicted fell 76% to 92% (shown); every
  ceiling was handed back. 12 gauge-rows better, 6 worse, 0 where the runs disagree. The tuning workload, shown and not
  counted, read the same way (hit rate 75% to 87%, the ceiling 64 to 299 MB).

### 16.5 The modelled realms and the independent simulators

Every result here is evidence class S: a statement about a published model under its own native controller, never about
hardware, and never counted in the Omni index.

- **The 945 muscles and six organisms** (`results/realms/REALMS.md`, A/B/C on v3): reproduced to the last digit in three
  of three runs; zero muscles worse; every organism superior within guardrails, with work per energy +0.1% to +0.3%, work
  unchanged and time over the line not above native's. On v2 the Physics realm and the tower had read a service tradeoff;
  the slack gate on speed knobs corrected it and made v3.
- **The grid of copies and runs** (`results/scale/GRID.md`, 84 of 90 cells on v3): every organism superior within
  guardrails in every cell of ten runs or more; work per energy +0.07% (Physics) to +0.37% (Energy, the four stacked, the
  tower), the same figure at every size; every knob handed back; the six cells left are beyond the machines available.
- **The power grid** (`V1_PANDAPOWER.md`, `V3_PANDAPOWER.md`, the same table to the digit): eleven SimBench grids solved
  by pandapower, the tap changer's own controller as native, one whole tap per move as the knob. With ZIP loads the energy
  the loads drew fell 1.3% to 1.5% and the net import fell in all eleven grids; losses fell in seven and **rose in four**
  (the rural and semi-urban grids with their own generation, +0.6% to +1.5%); tap operations fell in ten grids and rose
  from 4 to 8 a year in one, the declared cost, confirmed worse; no grid was more often outside its voltage band. 67
  gauge-rows better, 14 worse.
- **Robot arms** (`V1_MUJOCO.md`, `V1_MUJOCO_PANDA.md`, `V3_MUJOCO.md`): four arms from the MuJoCo Menagerie with their
  shipped controllers as native and the joint speed of an axis with slack as the knob, after a paired physics trial. The
  trial left the UR5e and the iiwa 14 native ("nothing for Omni to move"); on the Gen3 and the Panda, peak torque fell 29%
  and 10%, tracking error 21%, energy per takt 0.8% and 0.5%, confirmed better; the Panda's copper loss **rose 14%**,
  confirmed worse.
- **Buildings with batteries** (`V1_CITYLEARN.md`, `V3_CITYLEARN.md`): every district CityLearn ships, its own rule-based
  control as native, each building's battery charge and discharge inside the simulator's limits as the knob. In the
  eleven battery districts electricity bought, the daily peak and the daily unevenness fell in all eleven and carbon in
  eight, confirmed better; the bill **rose in seven** (the 2023 districts) and ramping rose in seven, confirmed worse; 71
  score-rows better, 33 worse, 1 where the runs differ by the simulator's own variation; three districts had nothing to
  move and eight the simulator cannot run.
- **Drone swarms** (`V3_SWARM.md`): twenty Crazyflie 2.x quadrotors in gym-pybullet-drones with the shipped position
  controller as native and the cruise override inside the autopilot's limits as the knob, three untouched cells. Energy a
  mission fell 7% (short), 18% (mixed) and 20% (long) and missions a charge rose 8%, 22% and 25%, confirmed better; no late
  mission, reserve breach, near miss or collision in any arm; the tracking error rose from 0.07 to 0.13 m inside its
  0.25 m band, shown; every override handed back. PyBullet reproduced to a part in a thousand across GitHub's machines and
  not to the bit, so the table's reproduction tolerance was set to one part in a thousand after the runs were seen, and
  the preregistration's amendment 1 says so with its time.

### 16.6 The one number, and the table

**The one number.** The Omni index over the real categories confirmed three times: **+30.2%** (real Kubernetes on v3 +25.5%,
the real database on v3 +14.2%, real messaging on v3 +166.9%, the real cache on v3 −24.9%, each category weighed the
same; Azure and the card join as their three-run tables land). The messaging figure is large because its speed ratio is:
native sat at nine tenths of its measured capacity by design, so its queue grew at the high steps and its slowest 5%
waited 1.6 s, while Omni's waited 9 to 14 ms; the resource that bought it, three to four times the consumers, stands
beside it as a confirmed loss. The cache's figure is negative because the memory held is its resource column: the ceiling
rose from 64 MB to 200 to 270 MB (a ratio of about 0.25 in the index's "fewer machines" sense) while work and the hit rate
rose 14% to 27%, and a geometric mean of those four columns is below one. That is the arithmetic of a resource bought,
reported as such; a reader who weighs memory as cheaper than a consumer or a machine will read the cache's rows for
themselves, which is why every row is in its table.

| **The same six Kubernetes tests on v3** (10 pairs × 3 runs each) | v3 | L | the same readings as v1, the controllers being v1's bytes: all four work inside the line +35% to +49%, p95 −47% to −66% across steady, wandering, all four and faults, failed requests −9% to −14% where they occur, steady machines −1.5% to −2.9%, batch machines −19% to −23% and standby-model energy −13% to −16%, all confirmed better; fairness no difference beyond the noise on every row | `results/live/V3_STEADY.md`, `V3_WANDERING.md`, `V3_ALL_FOUR.md`, `V3_FAIRNESS.md`, `V3_FAULTS.md`, `V3_BATCH.md` |
| **The six organisms with the real cluster inside**, 1 to 1,000 copies, 5 paired repetitions a cell (3 at 1,000) | v1 | L + S | 98 of 100 cells: p95 and time over the line better in every cell; 0 gauges worse beyond the noise except a rounding-level work loss (−0.0003%) and HPA replicas +0.7% in one cell; machines stay at 6 in both arms (no autoscaler under kind); the Physics realm and the tower at 1,000 copies off the clock in 2 of 3 repetitions (marked) | `results/live/V1_SIX_KUBE.md` |
| The same at 10 and 100 copies | v3 | L + S | 12 cells, 5 pairs each: every cell better on 4 to 6 gauges, worse on none beyond the noise except a rounding-level work loss in 4 cells; the stack at 100 copies off the clock in 4 of 5 repetitions (marked) | `results/live/V3_SIX_KUBE.md` |
| **The big organisms at 1,000 copies on a rented machine**: the tower (3 of 3) and the four stacked (3 of 3, detached) | v1 | L + S | tower: p95 **−95%** (4.1 s → 0.2 s) and time over the line −99.7% clear of the noise, machines 6 in both arms, energy −0.2%, work rounding-level worse, repetition 3 off the clock; stack: p95 **−74%** and p99 −83% clear of the noise, the compass arm 300 to 615 s past the 2,880 s window in all three (marked OFF THE CLOCK; native kept the clock), which is why the v3 stack runs with a 10,800 s window | `results/live/V1_BIG_ORGANISM.md` |

| **Power grid: 11 SimBench grids solved by pandapower**, both load models, A/B/C | v1 and v3 (the same table to the digit) | S | with ZIP loads the energy the loads drew confirmed better in all 11 (−1.3% to −1.5%) and the net import in all 11; losses confirmed better in 7 and **worse in 4** (the rural and semi-urban grids with their own generation, +0.6% to +1.5%); tap operations fewer in 10 grids, 4 → 8 a year in one (confirmed worse, the declared cost); no grid more often outside its band | `results/live/V1_PANDAPOWER.md`, `V3_PANDAPOWER.md` |
| **Robot arms, MuJoCo Menagerie**, A/B/C | v1 and v3 | S | where Omni-Compass moved (Gen3, Panda): peak torque −29% and −10%, tracking error −21%, energy per takt −0.8% and −0.5%, confirmed better; the Panda's copper loss +14% **confirmed worse**; UR5e and iiwa 14 left native by the paired physics trial | `results/live/V1_MUJOCO.md`, `V1_MUJOCO_PANDA.md`, `V3_MUJOCO.md` |
| **CityLearn, every district it ships**, A/B/C | v1 and v3 | S | 11 battery districts: electricity bought, daily peak and daily unevenness confirmed better in all 11, carbon in 8; the bill **worse in 7** (the 2023 districts) and ramping worse in 7; 71 score-rows better, 33 worse, 1 where the runs differ (the simulator's own variation); 3 districts with nothing to move; 8 the simulator cannot run | `results/live/V1_CITYLEARN.md`, `V3_CITYLEARN.md` |

| **Scale**: the controller governing 50, 500 and 1,000 simulated nodes (KWOK), decision time and correctness | every push | L | runs on every push | `results/scale/` |
| GPU, one card and the card inside the organisms | earlier card controller | P | **obsolete**: every earlier card result ran on a controller since replaced; the one-card, card-inside-1,000-copies and eight-card runs are run again by the founder on rented cards after the CPU and cloud work, at one named commit | `docs/GPU_PREREGISTRATION.md`, `docs/GPU_RUN_GUIDE.md` |

**Running now** (8 October): the four stacked at 1,000 copies on the detached machine; the robustness test
(`docs/ROBUSTNESS_PREREGISTRATION.md`), its one-repetition smoke run passed and the kill and long scenarios running as A, B
and C; YCSB on MongoDB (`docs/YCSB_PREREGISTRATION.md`), its smoke run first and then A, B and C; and Azure steady and burst on the fleet of several machine families (the first two dispatches were refused by the
subscription's family allowances before any arm ran, the next by Azure's own cluster capacity in eastus; the fleet is
rebuilt from the families the survey shows allowed). **Queued, in order, in `docs/REGISTER.md` section 4**: drone swarms and
defense edge (PX4 and ArduPilot multi-vehicle, Crazyswarm), databases and caches at large (YCSB, HammerDB), Spark,
OpenSearch, fio, Open-RMF, the 24-hour robustness run, spacecraft attitude and thrusters (Basilisk),
station-keeping (Orekit, GMAT), constellations, rockets (RocketPy, OpenRocket) and combustion (Cantera). Pure physics
solvers (OpenFOAM, SU2, REBOUND, GADGET, MESA) are not benchmarked: they have no controller and no knob, so Omni-Compass
has no place on them; their value is the HPC cluster that runs them.

### 16.7 Threats to validity, stated by us

A referee will look for the ways these results could mislead. We list the ones we know, what each would do to the
numbers, and what the record does about it.

1. **The machines are shared.** Every Kubernetes, database, broker and cache run is on one GitHub runner with four cores,
   and the governor, the load generator, the probe and the system under test share it. A governor that costs CPU can slow
   the service it governs, and a noisy neighbour on the host can move a run. The pairing on one runner with rotated order
   removes the between-machine noise; the host's own busy share is recorded beside every run; the governor's own CPU is a
   gauge in every table and a confirmed loss where it is one (the database, Kafka's light workload); and three separate
   runs on separate machines must agree before anything is confirmed.
2. **kind is not a cloud.** Idle machines stay powered and native has no node autoscaler, so a machine given back on kind
   is a machine-hour in service, not a watt and not a dollar. The energy rows on kind are a declared model and say so on
   every line. The bill is Azure's test, and its only result so far is inside the noise on a fleet too small to show one
   machine.
3. **Native is at its knee by design in the broker test.** The Kafka producer's peak offers nine tenths of the capacity
   measured for the operator's two consumers, so native's queue grows at the high steps and omni's does not. This is the
   situation the benchmark is of (a group sized for the quiet hours and overrun at the peak), it is preregistered, and it
   is why the latency ratios are large; the index page and the table say so. A native group sized for the peak would show
   a smaller latency gain and a smaller consumer cost, and would be a different, also legitimate, benchmark.
4. **Declared penalties.** The cache's 5 ms store trip on a miss and the broker's 1, 2 or 5 ms of CPU per message are
   declared parameters of our own application, not measurements of anyone's store. The gauges that depend on them (work
   inside the line, the request latency) scale with them; the hit rate, the lag, the consumers and the memory held do not.
5. **Simulators are models.** Every S result is a statement about a published model under its own controller. A model may
   flatter or punish the governor in ways the real plant would not. S results are therefore shown beside the index and
   never inside it, and the muscles' models are the simplest physics that reproduces the meter's response to the knob,
   with the native controllers tuned as their authors ship them.
6. **The tuning case was seen.** Every benchmark's rules were set on one tuning case, and that case is shown and not
   counted. Where a rule changed after a counted result was seen (the swarm table's reproduction tolerance), the amendment
   is written in the preregistration with its time and reason, the table says so, and the runs were not rerun.
7. **The engine changed twice.** v1 to v2 added muscles without touching the law; v2 to v3 added one gate. Every result is
   labelled with its engine, the tools refuse to mix engines, and the v1 results stay as v1 results. A reader comparing a v1
   number with a v3 number is comparing two engines, and the manual never does so except to say that the controllers were
   the same bytes and the readings the same.
8. **Three runs are three, not thirty.** The three-run rule is a replication standard, not a large sample. A row confirmed
   in three runs of ten pairs is a row whose paired difference cleared zero in each of three independent samples of ten;
   the intervals are shown so a reader can judge their width. Where the intervals are wide, the manual says the test lacked
   power rather than calling the result a null.
9. **The founder's own harness.** The application in front of the cache, the producer in front of the broker, the load
   generator and the probe are ours. They are declared, versioned, archived with every run and reproducible from the
   repository; they are not independent of us. The independent pieces are the systems under test, their native
   controllers, the simulators and their shipped controllers, and the benchmark tools (pgbench, kind, Kubernetes,
   PyBullet, MuJoCo, pandapower, CityLearn) that others wrote.

### 16.8 What is not yet shown, and the open program

Three things this manual does not show, and the program that will show them or show their absence:

- **An energy or bill saving on real machines.** The fleet of 40 workers in nine Azure machine families that can show one
  machine is preregistered and dispatched on v3; it runs when Azure's region admits a cluster. If the saving is a few
  percent, a 40-worker fleet can see it; if the saving is not there, the table will say "no difference beyond the noise"
  on a fleet that could have seen it, and that will be the result.
- **The real card.** Every earlier GPU result ran on a controller since replaced. The two-wire governor with the verdict
  runs on rented cards at one named commit, with the wire check first (`docs/GPU_RUN_GUIDE.md`,
  `docs/GPU_PREREGISTRATION.md`); until then the card has no result and the manual says so.
- **Robustness as a measured result.** The lease, the watchdog and the kill switch exist in code and are tested; the
  benchmark that kills the governor outright in a governed run, measures the seconds to hand-back and what the service
  saw, runs the governor for hours against drift and leaks, and prices its own CPU at 1, 10, 100 and 1,000 copies, is
  preregistered (`docs/ROBUSTNESS_PREREGISTRATION.md`, register row 31) with its harness built (`scripts/kind_robust.sh`,
  workflow `robustness`) and runs next. Its third part needs no new run: the governor's own CPU, from the audits of the
  runs already archived, is 0.006 to 0.013 of one core at every size from 1 to 1,000 copies, 0.1% to 0.3% of the host's
  cores (`results/live/V3_OWN_COST.md`; shown, not judged, each run under its own engine).

The queue beyond these, in order, is `docs/REGISTER.md` section 4, one or two at a time, each preregistered before it
runs: PX4 and ArduPilot swarms, YCSB and HammerDB, Spark, OpenSearch, fio, Open-RMF, the 24-hour run, Basilisk, Orekit and
GMAT, RocketPy and OpenRocket, Cantera. When the founder declares the engine final, the engine that stands then is
published as Omni-Compass 1.0, and the older fingerprints go to `docs/history` as the road to it.

## 42. The Pilot Protocol and Kit

### Pilot Protocol



> **Before you wire anything:** read [`DISCLOSURES.md`](../DISCLOSURES.md). Omni-Compass acts only through the wires it is given; it cannot be slapped on. If your paired receipts differ from the published benchmarks in direction, the first presumption is wiring: confirm the installation with section 8.5 of the manual (*Wired right or wired wrong*).

#### Phase 0: Simulation evaluation (evaluator's own environment)
Run `python verify.py`. Pass criterion: VERIFICATION: PASS.

#### Phase 1: Shadow (2 to 4 weeks)
- Capture: `OUT=capture.csv INTERVAL=15 DURATION=<seconds> POWER_CMD="<site power in watts>" bash fleet/capture/kube_capture.sh` (read-only).
- Replay: `python fleet/capture_replay.py capture.csv --idle-w <W> --dyn-w <W> --site-limit-w <W> --out replay/` gives Omni-Compass's recommended node count, power cap and HPA target per decision.
- Governor in OBSERVE on production telemetry read directly from nodes (kubelet/cAdvisor metrics, power meters, queue depth).
- No write credentials are issued.
- Logged per interval: directive, native actions taken, and the observed outcome.
- Pass criteria, agreed before start: logged directives never violate I1 to I5; counterfactual analysis on at least N recorded incidents shows the directive would have reduced time-to-recovery or energy without a backlog increase beyond an agreed bound.

#### Phase 2: Guarded control, one loop at a time (4 to 8 weeks)
Order: power capping; node count (Cluster Autoscaler set to observe); replica count (HPA set to observe).
- Each loop is handed over separately, with the reset tested at handover and at exit.
- Pass criteria per loop, fixed in advance: SLO attainment not worse than the preceding shadow baseline at the agreed confidence level; zero shield invariant violations; energy per unit of completed work reported with confidence intervals.
- Exit: any criterion failed triggers the reset and returns the loop to its native controller.

#### Scoring your own pilot
Capture the baseline (a period before the controller, or a matched node pool left on your normal autoscaler) and the
Omni-Compass period or pool with fleet/capture/kube_capture.sh, then:
`python pilot/score.py --baseline baseline.csv --omni omni.csv [--idle-w W --dyn-w W]`
It reports node-hours and energy per used CPU core-hour, utilisation, pending-pod minutes and HPA shortfall minutes, each
with a bootstrap 95% interval over hourly blocks. Energy is measured if the captures include power_w. Run long enough
for at least 24 blocks per side, and compare matched pools at the same time where possible, because traffic changes
between periods.

#### Phase 3: Component retirement
A decision component is retired only after its loop has passed Phase 2 and a one-at-a-time removal shows no degradation (keep-or-remove rule, Manual Chapter 6). Execution and security components are retained.

#### Reporting
All pilot metrics, including failures, are reported in the same format as the benchmark results.

### Omni-Compass shadow pilot kit



What a customer runs first. Omni-Compass watches the cluster read-only beside its own autoscalers. Every 15 seconds it
decides what it would do, using the same closure law that was benchmarked. It never writes.

1. `kubectl config use-context <the cluster>`
2. `DURATION=86400 IDLE_W=<watts per idle node> DYN_W=<watts at full load> bash scripts/pilot_shadow.sh`
   - It proves with `kubectl auth can-i` that the identity can read and cannot write, and stops if any write permission
     exists.
   - It captures telemetry and logs every recommendation to `shadow_out/audit.jsonl`.
   - It writes `shadow_out/SHADOW_REPORT.md`: node-hours used against node-hours Omni-Compass would have used, and the
     write count, which must be 0.
3. Scoring against a matched baseline: `python pilot/score.py --baseline baseline.csv --omni omni.csv` (bootstrap
   intervals over hourly blocks).

Guarded control follows `docs/PILOT_PROTOCOL.md`: one loop at a time, the reset tested at each handover.

The kit is exercised end to end on kind by the `live-shadow` workflow.

## 43. The GPU Bench



> **Before you wire anything:** read [`DISCLOSURES.md`](../DISCLOSURES.md). Omni-Compass acts only through the wires it is given; it cannot be slapped on. If your paired receipts differ from the published benchmarks in direction, the first presumption is wiring: confirm the installation with section 8.5 of the manual (*Wired right or wired wrong*).

This is the test that answers "does Omni-Compass save real energy?" with the GPU's own power meter. There is no model
in it. Nobody has run it yet on real hardware for this repository; the first run is the first real-meter result.

### What you need

- A Linux machine with one NVIDIA GPU (a rented cloud GPU works: A100, H100, L4, A10, RTX), the NVIDIA driver and
  `nvidia-smi`.
- Python 3 with PyTorch built for CUDA (`pip install torch numpy`).
- Root, because setting a GPU power limit (`nvidia-smi -pl`) needs it. Persistence mode on is recommended
  (`sudo nvidia-smi -pm 1`); the receipt records it either way.

### Run it

```bash
git clone <this repository> && cd <it>
sudo bash scripts/gpu_paired.sh                       # 5 repetitions, 10 minutes per arm: about 3 hours
sudo REPS=5 DURATION=300 bash scripts/gpu_paired.sh   # 5-minute arms: about 1.5 hours
```

Options (environment variables): `REPS`, `DURATION` (s per arm), `DRAIN` (s after arrivals stop), `COOLDOWN` (s idle
before each arm), `GPU` (index), `SAMPLE_MS`, `INTERVAL` (s between Omni decisions), `SLO_MS` (response-time target;
default ten bare service times), `WORKLOAD_ARGS` (e.g. `--n 8192 --target-ms 80`).

### Two phases

- `PHASE=smoke` (the default): look for faults and for an effect worth confirming. Any number of repetitions.
- `PHASE=confirm`: the preregistered test (`docs/GPU_PREREGISTRATION.md`), 10 repetitions. Omni's code must be
  committed; its files are hashed before the first arm and again after the last, and any change invalidates the run.

```bash
sudo PHASE=confirm bash scripts/gpu_paired.sh
```

The **primary outcome** is work per energy: requests served per kilojoule the GPU drew.

### What it does

1. **Receipt.** GPU name, UUID, VBIOS, driver, kernel, host, persistence mode, power management, the enforced limit,
   default, minimum, maximum and current power limit, the workload's hash, the mechanism id, git commit
   (`receipt.json`). The current power limit is the **snapshot**; every arm must start and end at it. The bench
   refuses to start unless power management is Enabled (otherwise a written limit would not bind).
2. **Calibrate once.** The workload times its request at the snapshot limit and picks the request size so one request
   takes about 50 ms (`calib.json`). Every arm uses the same calibration.
3. **Three arms per repetition, order rotated,** each after `COOLDOWN` s idle:
   - **native**: no Omni process.
   - **watch**: Omni runs, reads the GPU and decides, and is forbidden to write. This is the control: it shows what
     the machine does with Omni present and silent. If it writes even once, the run is invalid.
   - **omni**: Omni writes the GPU power limit.
4. **The same work in every arm.** `tools/gpu_workload.py` sends one seeded stream of requests (fp16 matrix products)
   at 30%, 60%, 80%, 30%, 60% and 30% of the GPU's full-power capacity. Every arm gets the same requests at the same
   moments.
5. **Measured by the device.** `nvidia-smi` samples power draw, temperature, utilisation, the power limit, the
   **enforced** power limit and the clock-limit reasons every 200 ms for the whole arm (the fields the driver reports,
   listed in `smi_fields.txt`); RAPL CPU package counters are read at both ends where the machine has them. This is
   receipt C, the outcome: Omni never supplies it.
6. **Reset.** After the omni arm Omni restores the snapshot limit and reads it back. The script checks the limit
   after every arm.
7. **The table** (`GPU_REPS.md`): each gauge for native, watch and omni, and three paired contrasts with 95%
   intervals — observation (watch − native), authority (omni − watch), total (omni − native). If an interval includes
   zero, it says **not proven**. The result label is chosen by rule (`docs/GPU_PREREGISTRATION.md`, amendment 1):
   SUPERIOR WITHIN GUARDRAILS, ENERGY IMPROVEMENT WITH SERVICE TRADEOFF, NONINFERIOR / INCONCLUSIVE, NOT ESTABLISHED,
   WORSE, or INVALID. Also: actuator fidelity (receipt B), control effort and representation fidelity (receipt A). A
   meter that was not fitted prints UNAVAILABLE. The run folder holds every raw file and `SHA256SUMS.txt`.

### What Omni does on the GPU (omni_controller/gpu_governor.py)

Every 2 s it reads the GPU and runs the Omni-Compass engine (the throughput law in `omnicompass/adapter.py`): load is
GPU utilisation, power stress is draw over the snapshot limit, heat is temperature over 83 C, queue is response-time
pressure. The engine's power cap becomes a power limit, inside hard rules:

- never below the GPU's current draw x 1.3, never below 0.70 of the snapshot (`--min-share`), never below the device
  minimum, never above the snapshot;
- a busy card (utilisation smoothed over decisions at or over 0.5, `--util-gate`) gets the snapshot limit back at once,
  and the cap returns only under 0.4;
- optional speed lock (`--baseline-file`, from `tools/gpu_baseline.py` on runs without Omni): the limit follows
  response time against that baseline, every gauge kept at least 1% faster (`docs/INTEGRATION_MANUAL.md`, level 5);
- no new write until the last one reads back from the device; every write is read back at once and recorded
  (requested, return code, read back, enforced limit, delay); the engine senses the enforced limit, the one the card
  obeys; a write the device refuses ends the arm (exit 4) and makes the run invalid; no clock locks are ever written;
- if it cannot read the GPU or the response times, the snapshot limit at once;
- if response time breaks its target, the snapshot limit at once, and for three decisions after;
- kill file or SIGTERM: the snapshot limit, read back.

- **one writer:** if the limit ever reads a value Omni did not write, Omni stops writing, leaves that limit alone,
  and exits 5 (the run is invalid);
- **heat fails up:** while the card reports a thermal or hardware slowdown, no lower limit is written;
- every decision names every rule that held the engine back (`blocked_by`) and the one that decided (`decided_by`).

Any workload plugs in through `WORKLOAD_CMD` (for example a vLLM or MLPerf inference harness), if it writes
`latency.csv`, `requests.csv` and `summary.json` in `tools/gpu_workload.py`'s format and `SLO_MS` is given.

The table also credits each write: joules and requests against native at the same moments of the same stream, grouped
by the rule that decided it. CPU energy comes from RAPL by domain: package and DRAM apart, psys never added, wrap
undone. The card's own energy counter (NVML) and its ECC and retired-page counters are read at both ends of each arm.

### Gauges

| Gauge | From | Better |
|---|---|---|
| **work per energy (served requests per kJ), primary** | requests served / GPU energy | higher |
| energy, GPU (J) | power.draw integrated over the arm's window | lower |
| energy per served request (J) | the same, over requests served | lower |
| power, GPU mean (W) | energy / window | lower |
| requests served, not served | the workload's own record | more served, fewer not |
| response time mean, 95th, 99th percentile (ms) | arrival to finish of each request | lower |
| temperature, peak and mean (C) | temperature.gpu | lower |
| energy, CPU package (J) | RAPL counters, when present | lower |

### Testing the bench without a GPU

`python tests/test_gpu_bench.py` runs the whole script against a stand-in `nvidia-smi` (`tests/fake_gpu/`), with the
workload's `--sim` mode. The stand-in has no real power physics, so its numbers mean nothing; it proves the script,
the controls and the validity checks work.

## 44. The GPU Preregistration



Written before any hardware trial. The confirmation run (`PHASE=confirm`) hashes this file with the code in
`FREEZE.json`; a change to either after the run starts invalidates it.

### Question

On one NVIDIA GPU serving a fixed, seeded request stream, does Omni-Compass holding the GPU power limit change the
successful work done per joule measured by the device, compared with the device left at its own limit?

Fixed here, before any smoke trial:
- the number of confirmation repetitions (10);
- the primary outcome;
- the guardrails;
- the analysis.

Nothing seen in smoke may change them.

### Two phases

1. **Smoke** (`PHASE=smoke`, any number of repetitions). Its purpose is to find faults in the harness, and to see
   whether the effect is large enough to be worth confirming. Smoke results are not published and are never
   reported as the result. After smoke, Omni's code may change.
2. **Confirmation** (`PHASE=confirm`). Omni's code is committed and frozen before the first trial. The script refuses
   to run if any frozen file has uncommitted changes, and the table marks the run invalid if a frozen file changes
   during it. No inspection, tuning or rerun between confirmation trials. If the confirmation fails, it is reported
   as failed; a new confirmation needs a new commit and a new run, and both runs are reported.

### Design

- **Arms:** native (no Omni), watch (Omni runs, may not write), omni (Omni writes the GPU power limit).
- **Repetitions:** 10 in confirmation, each with all three arms back to back, order rotated. Repetitions may run on
  separate machines of one GPU type (`REP_ONLY`, the GitHub workflow); the three arms of a repetition always share
  one machine, so every comparison is paired within a machine.
- **Per arm:** 60 s idle, then the pinned workload for 600 s plus 30 s drain.
- **Workload:** `tools/gpu_workload.py`, calibrated once at the start power limit before any arm. The seed is
  20260928, and the load phases are 30, 60, 80, 30, 60 and 30% of full-power capacity.

### Outcomes

- **Primary:** work per energy = requests served / GPU energy (kJ). GPU energy is `nvidia-smi` power.draw
  integrated over the arm's window.
- **Secondary:**
  - GPU energy;
  - energy per served request;
  - requests not served;
  - response time: mean, 95th and 99th percentile;
  - peak temperature;
  - CPU package energy (RAPL), where present;
  - where a smart plug is fitted (`WALL_METER`), whole-machine energy at the wall and work per wall kJ. The plug is
    read by the bench only, never by Omni. An arm whose plug readings have a gap over 5 s has no wall number.

### Analysis

- **Primary comparison:** omni against native, paired by repetition. Report the mean difference with a two-sided t
  95% interval.
- **Result:**
  - The result is *proven better* if the interval lies entirely above zero.
  - It is *proven worse* if the interval lies entirely below zero.
  - Otherwise it is *not proven*.
- **Guardrails, fixed now:** a better primary result counts only if Omni did not buy it with the work. Both
  guardrails must hold:
  - **Requests served:** the 95% interval of (omni − native) must not reach below −1% of native.
  - **95th-percentile response time:** the interval must not reach above +10% of native.

  If a guardrail fails, the verdict is *better on energy, fails the service guardrail*. That is a different product
  and is reported as such.
- **Watch against native:** reported as the cost of Omni being present. If watch differs from native on the primary
  outcome as much as omni does, the effect is not attributed to Omni's authority.

### Amendment 1 (2026-09-28, before any hardware trial; no smoke or confirmation data exist)

Added before any data, to make the chain from engine to plant identifiable. The question, the arms, the primary
outcome, the repetitions, and the two guardrails above are unchanged.

- **Three contrasts, all reported, each paired by repetition:** observation = watch − native; authority = omni −
  watch; total = omni − native (the primary comparison). A total effect is not attributed to Omni's authority where
  the observation contrast differs materially from zero.
- **Third guardrail, errors:** the 95% interval of (omni − native) requests *not* served must not reach above +1% of
  native requests served.
- **Result label, by rule, never by hand** (`tools/gpu_reps.py`, `label()`):
  - primary proven better, all three guardrails held: **SUPERIOR WITHIN GUARDRAILS**;
  - primary proven better, a guardrail failed: **ENERGY IMPROVEMENT WITH SERVICE TRADEOFF**;
  - primary not proven, all guardrails held: **NONINFERIOR / INCONCLUSIVE**;
  - primary not proven, a guardrail failed: **NOT ESTABLISHED**;
  - primary proven worse: **WORSE**;
  - any invalidity below: **INVALID**.
- **The card obeys enforced.power.limit.** The snapshot records power.limit, enforced.power.limit, default, min and
  max limits, persistence mode and power management. The bench refuses to start unless power management is Enabled.
  The bench samples enforced.power.limit where the driver reports it. The governor senses the enforced limit and reads
  back every write at once; it never writes clock locks.
- **Also invalid:** a native or watch arm whose enforced limit differs from the snapshot; a governor that exits
  nonzero (a refused start, or a write the device refused — that write ends the arm); smoke and confirmation
  repetitions mixed in one table.
- **Three receipts, kept apart.** A (governor, `audit.jsonl` decisions): telemetry consumed; the six-state reading
  (history-dependent, `state_observed`); the memoryless state the telemetry alone points to (`state_measured`); the
  U-channel command u evaluated on the evolved state (`u_push`); admissibility; requested and granted authority; shield
  bound; holds. B (actuator, `actuator` records): requested limit, return code, power.limit read back, enforced limit,
  delay to realization, override (enforced under requested), restoration. C (outcome, the bench alone): nvidia-smi
  power, joules, temperature, utilization, clock-limit reasons; the workload's requests, latency and failures. Omni
  never supplies its own outcome.
- **Secondary, descriptive (no verdict):**
  - actuator fidelity: r_act = read back − requested (mean and max absolute), delay (median, max), enforced-under-requested
    count, total variation of the realized limit, reversals, refused writes;
  - control effort: J_u = sum of abs(u_push) × decision interval; mean and max abs(u_push); saturations
    (abs(u_push) = 25); shield interventions (a bound other than the engine decided); holds;
  - representation fidelity: R_int = sqrt(mean over consecutive decision pairs of sum_k w_k (h(z_(k+1)) −
    F_h(h(z_k), u_k))_k²) over E, U, I_U, S, B, weights 1, with h the memoryless map and F_h the engine's own
    projection (`state_projected_next`); directional accuracy = share of pairs where sign(projected − current reading)
    equals sign(next measured − current measured), both movements at least 0.01, per state and by predicted size
    (0.01–0.03, 0.03–0.1, ≥ 0.1);
  - energy of the rest of the machine = wall − GPU − CPU package, only when all three meters measured the arm. A
    missing meter prints UNAVAILABLE, never a modelled substitute.
- **Smoke never enters confirmation.** A smoke run that changes any code or parameter is followed by: repair, the
  tests, a new freeze, and a confirmation collected from zero.

### The run is invalid, and reported as invalid, if

- the watch arm executes any power-limit write;
- a native or watch arm sees a power limit other than the snapshot;
- any arm ends at a limit other than the snapshot (the reset failed);
- Omni's frozen files change during the run;
- the confirmation runs on uncommitted code.

### Recorded for every Omni decision

Every decision is logged in `audit.jsonl`:
- the raw device telemetry: utilisation, draw, temperature, limit, SM clock, and clock-limit reasons where the driver
  reports them;
- the engine's six-state reading, the state it had projected for this moment, and the error against it;
- the projection for the next decision. This is the engine's own evolved state from the same step that sets the cap;
  no separate predictor was added for the experiment;
- whether change was admissible, the requested and granted authority, and which shield bound decided the limit;
- the limit written, and the requests served in the window.

### Amendment 2 (2026-09-28, before any hardware trial; no smoke or confirmation data exist)

Unchanged:
- the question;
- the arms;
- the primary outcome;
- the repetitions;
- the guardrails of amendment 1.

- **Watch must match native.** If the observation contrast (watch − native) on the primary outcome is proven in
  either direction, the label is **NOT ATTRIBUTABLE: WATCH DIFFERS FROM NATIVE** and no omni result is published.
- **One writer.** If the power limit ever reads a value that is neither Omni's last write nor the limit before it,
  another writer is present:
  - the governor stops writing for the rest of the run;
  - it leaves that writer's limit alone;
  - it exits 5;
  - the run is invalid.
- **Heat fails up.** While the device reports a thermal or hardware slowdown (clock-limit reason bits 0x8, 0x20,
  0x40, 0x80), no lower limit is written.
- **Credit per write (descriptive).** Each write owns the interval to the next. For that interval, the table records
  GPU joules and requests finished, Omni minus native, at the same moments of the same seeded stream. It records who
  decided the write: the engine, a floor, the busy gate, a reflex, heat, or the speed lock. The table says which rule
  produced the joules; a speed-lock result is not credited to the engine.
- **CPU side (secondary, never on the control path).** RAPL counters are read by domain name at both ends of each arm:
  - `package-N` is summed as CPU package; `dram` is summed separately;
  - `psys` is recorded and never added to either;
  - wrapping is undone with `max_energy_range_uj`;
  - a counter that went backwards without a known range, or is missing, prints UNAVAILABLE.
  - The governor never reads these counters.
- **Device energy counter (cross-check, secondary).** Where NVML reports it (Volta and newer), the card's total-energy
  counter is read at both ends of each arm, beside the integrated power.draw.
- **Card health (descriptive).** Uncorrected and corrected ECC error counts, and pages pending retirement, are read at
  both ends of each arm.
- **Workload plug.** Any workload may be served through `WORKLOAD_CMD` if it writes the pinned workload's files. It
  needs its own response-time target (`SLO_MS`). The command is recorded in the receipt. A confirmation names its
  workload before the first trial.

### Amendment 3 (2026-10-01, before any hardware trial; no smoke or confirmation data exist)

No GPU job has ever been given a machine (every gpu-bench run so far waited in the queue and was cancelled), so no
trial data exist. Unchanged:
- the question;
- the arms;
- the primary outcome;
- the repetitions;
- the guardrails, labels and invalidity rules of amendments 1 and 2.

- **Declared envelope, before any trial.** The buyer's service envelope is written to a file before the first trial
  and recorded with the run (`envelope.json` in the run folder and in every repetition):
  - `power_min_w`, the lowest watts Omni may set. Default (`tools/declare_envelope.py`): max(device minimum, 70% of the
    power limit read at declaration), rounded up to whole watts;
  - `power_max_w`, the power limit read at declaration;
  - optionally `slo_ms`, the response-time target; without it the target comes from calibration (10 bare service
    times), as before.
  - The bench refuses an envelope whose floor lies outside [device minimum, starting limit].
  - **The confirmation refuses to start without a declared envelope** (`scripts/gpu_paired.sh`, `ENVELOPE`).
- **Envelope floor.** The governor never sets the limit under `power_min_w` (`--floor-w`). When the floor is what
  lifted a write, the decision record names it (`decided_by`: envelope_floor), so no saving below the floor can be
  credited to the engine.
- **Outer controller holds.** When the card's own controller (board, BMC or system policy) already holds
  enforced.power.limit under the current limit, a lower write that would still sit above that enforced limit changes
  nothing on the card. It is not written; the decision record marks it (`outer_controller_holds`). Only a write that
  would actually bind, or a return upward, goes out. This is not another writer (amendment 2): the set limit is
  unchanged and the governor keeps running.
- **Narrow cards are reported as they are.** The device's own limit range is in the snapshot. On a card whose range is
  narrow (for example a 70 W card that accepts 60–70 W), the envelope is that narrow range; the result is reported for
  that card and range and not extrapolated to wider cards.

### Amendment 4 (2026-10-02, after an invalid smoke; no confirmation data exist)

The first smoke on a rented A10 (results/gpu/smoke-20261002T032459Z, never counted) was invalid by rule: two copies of
`scripts/gpu_rented_run.sh` had been started on the same machine, so both benches wrote the same card's power limit.
The native and watch arms saw limits they never wrote (116, 137 and 150 W), each governor refused to start beside the
other one (exit 5), and one reset restore was undone by the other copy. The card also began at 116 W, a limit an
earlier start had left behind, not its 150 W default, so native itself ran capped (83% of samples). None of these
numbers measures Omni. The engine, the governor, the outcomes and the analysis are unchanged. The run script now:

- **runs once per machine:** it takes a lock and refuses to start while another copy runs;
- **runs alone on the card:** it refuses to start while any other process is using the GPU;
- **starts from the card's default limit:** it sets power.default_limit before the envelope is declared, so the
  envelope, the snapshot and every arm start from the card's own default, not from a limit an earlier run left behind.

### Amendment 5 (2026-10-02, before any valid hardware trial; the only smoke so far was invalid, amendment 4)

The Omni arm changes engine. The outcomes, the arms' order, the guardrails, the analysis and the validity rules are
unchanged.

- **The Omni arm holds two wires** (`omni_controller/gpu_compass.py`, the compass law of `omnicompass/compass_law.py`): the clock
  ceiling (`nvidia-smi -lgc`, reset with `-rgc`; cover 35% of the top clock to the top), which sets how high the card's own boost may climb, and the power
  limit (`-pl`), the lid at what a fully busy card draws at that ceiling plus 10%, never under the declared envelope
  floor and never over the start limit. The service is read as one position between calm and the response-time line
  (the worse of p95 and utilization above half) and pulled to the middle; past 95% both wires go to full at once
  (fail up). The card's firmware keeps its own control; Omni sets only those two values. The earlier power-limit-only
  governor stays available (`OMNI_ENGINE=one_wire`) and is not the confirmation's arm.
- **Why, before the run:** on a modelled card (`results/sim/gpu_two_wire/`, evidence class S, seeds never used while
  tuning) the one-wire governor gave +0.1% work per energy and the two-wire engine +9.0%. That is a model; this run
  is the card's own meter.
- **The watch arm** runs the same two-wire engine in watch mode: it computes and records both wires and writes
  neither.
- **The clock range is reset before and after every arm** (`-rgc`), as the power limit already was; the run script
  resets it once at the start.
- **The wire check runs first** (`tools/gpu_wire_check.py`): the card's clock must follow a lowered ceiling down and
  come back up when reset, the power limit must read back what was set, the governor must hand both wires back when
  stopped and must leave a limit set by another writer alone (exit 5). If any step fails, nothing else runs and the
  check's report names the wire, the step and what the card said.
- **Wire check, corrected before any trial (2026-10-02):** on the A10 the first wire check failed at "3 up wire
  (follows up)" although the wire works: under the heavy check load the card's own 150 W limit already held it near
  990 MHz, so a ceiling at 60% of the top clock (1017 MHz) left no room for the clock to come back up above it. The
  check now reads the card's busy clock on its own first and locks at 60% of that. The governor likewise starts its
  ceiling at the clock the busy card actually runs (a ceiling above it holds nothing), and its clock cover is 35% of
  the top clock to the top. No trial had run.

### Amendment 6 (2026-10-02, after the first confirmation and before any further trial)

**What the first confirmation showed** (A10, commit `c908054`, `results/gpu/run-20261002T082232Z/`): work per energy
+3.6% (+2.7% to +4.5%, proven), the same requests served, no request lost, but the 95th-percentile response time
+58.5% (510 to 809 ms), so the response-time guardrail failed and the label by rule was ENERGY IMPROVEMENT WITH
SERVICE TRADEOFF. It stands as the result of that run.

**Why, from the card's own samples:** while busy the card ran at 736 to 768 MHz under Omni against 861 to 889 MHz on
its own, and spent about 30% more time busy for the same work; requests queued behind each slower one. Three faults
in the governor, not in the engine: (1) the position counted utilization above half as service trouble, so every
burst read as past the wall (fail up in 46% of decisions) and every quiet gap pulled the ceiling down, so each burst
began on a lowered clock; (2) the lid followed a curve from the top clock and sat at the 105 W envelope floor in 49 of
165 compass decisions, under the 135 W the card itself draws while busy; (3) the ceiling's cover reached 35% of the top
clock, far under the clock the card's own power limit holds it at while busy.

**The Omni arm from now on** (`omni_controller/gpu_compass.py`; the outcomes, arms, guardrails, analysis and validity
rules are unchanged):

- the position is response time only (p95 over 5 s, not 30 s); being busy is not a breach;
- **race while work waits:** at 95% utilization or more the ceiling goes to the top and the lid to the start limit;
  the compass paces only the slack between bursts;
- **the card's own level, learned from its own meter** while the ceiling is at the top and the card is busy: its
  busy clock (median) and busy draw (90th percentile); until 15 such readings are in, neither wire moves;
- **speed floor:** the ceiling never goes under the card's own busy clock; **lid floor:** the lid never goes under the
  card's own busy draw plus 10%;
- fail up (past 95% of the line, or blind) is unchanged.

**On the modelled card, before any trial** (`results/sim/gpu_two_wire/`, seeds 5000 to 5009): p95 122.1 ms native,
123.7 ms with the corrected compass; work per energy +8.2% (+6.3% to +10.1%); energy -7.5%; the median response 10.1 to
12.1 ms, slower in the quiet stretches the compass paces. That is a model; the next trial is the card's own meter.

### Amendment 7 (2026-10-02, before any further trial)

The outcomes, arms, guardrails, analysis and validity rules are unchanged. The Omni arm of the confirmation runs the
**service** profile.

- **Two profiles, one switch** (`--profile`, `omni_controller/gpu_compass.py`; the same in `realms/gpu_card.py`):
  - **service**, the default and the confirmation's arm: down gain 0.0125, the compass's center at 0.4, the speed floor 3%
    above the card's own busy clock;
  - **batch**: down gain 0.015, center 0.5, the floor at the card's own busy clock, for work nobody waits on answer by
    answer. It may be run as a separate, declared confirmation (`OMNI_ARGS="--profile batch"`) and is reported as its
    own result, never pooled with service.
- **How service was chosen, on the model, before the trial** (20 paired seeds, 5000-5009 and 5100-5109; ratios
  summarised as the geometric mean of the per-seed ratios): down gains 0.01, 0.0125, 0.015, 0.0175 and 0.02 alone, and
  0.0125 to 0.0175 crossed with the compass's center (0.4, 0.5), the speed floor (1.00, 1.03 of the card's own busy clock)
  and the race threshold (0.90, 0.95). The rule: the most work per energy at which no seed's p95 is more than 10% slower
  than native. Service (0.0125, 0.4, 1.03) gave work per energy +5.3% (+4.2 to +6.5), energy -5.0%, p95 -4.1% (-9.7 to
  +1.7), worst seed +9%, 0 of 20 seeds more than 10% slower, p99 -1.8%; its neighbours gave the same within a point.
  0.015 alone gave +6.2% but 3 of 20 seeds 10% to 48% slower at p95; 0.01 alone gave +3.8% with p95 -1.9%.
- **The ceiling moves in whole clock steps** (--min-change-mhz, 15 MHz), as the card's own clock does and as the model
  moves it: the force times the gain, as a share of the top clock, is rounded to whole steps, and a pull under half a
  step moves nothing and is not stored up.
- **The position reads the mean response time of the window** (as the model does), between the bare service time and
  the line; the 95th percentile at or past the line, or any failed request, is past the wall (fail up).
- **The model's report summarises ratios on the log scale** (`tools/run_gpu_card.py`): the arithmetic mean of per-seed
  percentages let one seed (+240%) stand for twenty.

### Amendment 8 (2026-10-03, before any further trial)

The outcomes, arms, guardrails, analysis and validity rules are unchanged, except as stated here.

- **Omni-Compass moves the card only where it measures that the card is no worse for it** (`omnicompass/verdict.py`, in
  `omni_controller/gpu_compass.py` and `realms/gpu_card.py`). While the service is calm, the governor runs a paired trial:
  - first the ceiling at the top until 30 requests are measured;
  - then one 15 MHz step past the deepest step already allowed, until 30 more are measured.

  Each request's cost is the card's own time on it: the workload's new `service_ms` column, start to done, with the
  wait in the queue left out. The step is allowed if its median cost is at most **2%** above the median at the top.
  Otherwise it is refused and not tried again for 900 decisions. The compass may move the ceiling only between the top and
  the deepest allowed step. Where no step passes, the ceiling stays at the top and the card runs as it does alone. Every
  trial and every judgement is in the audit (`verdict`, `verdict_state`, `verdict_deepest_step`).
- **One law, no profiles.** The service and batch profiles are removed. The law is: down gain 0.0125, the compass's center
  0.4, the speed floor at the card's own busy clock, and the verdict's allowance of 2%. The batch profile paced past the
  2% allowance, so it is gone.
- **Why 2%** (the card model, 20 paired seeds):
  - an allowance of 0 leaves the card native on every workload, because every clock step down adds some time to a
    request, and saves nothing;
  - 2% is the smallest allowance that saves energy, and it is below what a person or a service contract can notice.
- **A second workload, AI token generation** (`tools/gpu_workload.py --kind decode`): fp16 matrix-times-vector over
  1 GiB of weights per pass, batch one, so each pass streams every weight from memory, as token generation does. It runs
  as a second confirmation of the same design (10 repetitions × 3 arms × 600 s) after the compute-bound one
  (`scripts/gpu_rented_run.sh`; `SKIP_DECODE=1` skips it). It is labelled by the same rule and reported as its own
  result, never pooled.
- **Every comparison is a base alone against the same base with Omni on top.** The model's report
  (`tools/run_gpu_card.py`) runs two bases:
  - the card's own firmware, alone and with Omni on top;
  - an operator's fixed 105 W power cap, alone and with Omni on top.

  The old one-wire governor is removed as an arm (it was Omni's own earlier version).
- **On the modelled card, before any trial** (`results/sim/gpu_two_wire/`, firmware alone against firmware with Omni on
  top; tuning seeds 5000-5009, fresh seeds 5100-5109):
  - compute-bound work: work per energy +0.70% (tuning) and +0.48% (fresh); median +1.56% and +1.47%; p95, p99 and
    time over the line unchanged within their intervals;
  - AI token generation: work per energy +3.36% and +3.86%; median +0.55% and +0.70%; p95 +0.29% and +0.26%; time over
    the line 0.

  That is a model; the next trial is the card's own meter.

### Amendment 9 (2026-10-03, before any trial on this code)

Everything in amendment 8 stands. Four additions, each run by `scripts/gpu_rented_run.sh` after the two confirmations
and each reported as its own result:

1. **Steady under the limit** (`omni_controller/gpu_compass.py`, the same in `realms/gpu_card.py`). While the card is
   saturated against its own power limit (work waiting, the draw at 97% of the limit or more), the firmware boosts a
   step, hits the limit and is knocked back. The ceiling is then held at the card's own busy clock under that limit,
   so the same watts serve the work without the knock-backs. It is never held under that clock, the lid stays at the
   start limit, and a blind feed still fails up. In the card model, fully loaded under a fixed cap, this gives about
   +0.6% requests served from the same watts, with p95 about 2% faster.
2. **An operator's power cap underneath.** The card's limit is set to the envelope's lowest watts (70% of its default)
   before the run, and the paired bench runs native (the cap alone), watch and Omni-Compass on top of the cap (the lid
   never above the cap). It runs twice, 5 repetitions × 3 arms × 300 s each time:
   - at the usual load;
   - fully loaded (arrivals at 130% of the card's capacity under the cap), so the result is requests served from the same watts.

   The card is returned to its default limit afterwards.
3. **The GPU fault drill** (`scripts/gpu_fault_drill.sh`). With the request stream running:
   - the governor is killed outright, and the watchdog must hand the card back;
   - the master switch is pulled, and the governor must hand back, exit and refuse to restart while OFF;
   - the response feed is paused, and the governor must fail up.

   Every check must pass, and the card must end at its start limit.
4. **Real AI serving** (`scripts/gpu_vllm.sh`, `tools/llm_workload.py`). An open language model
   (Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct) is served by vLLM, installed in its own environment. It is asked the same seeded stream
   of prompts in every arm, each for exactly 128 new tokens; 5 repetitions × 3 arms × 300 s. Tokens per second and
   tokens per kilojoule follow from requests served. If vLLM cannot be installed or started on the machine, the stage
   says so and nothing measured before it changes.

### Amendment 10 (2026-10-03, before any trial on several cards)

Everything in amendments 8 and 9 stands. **Several cards in one server** (`scripts/gpu_8card.sh`): every card runs
`scripts/gpu_rented_run.sh` at the same time, each on its own card with its own wire check, envelope, smoke, the two
confirmations and the power cap underneath, on the same committed code. Card i starts its arm rotation i steps later
(`ROT_OFFSET`), so no arm always meets the same neighbours. Each repetition stays paired within its own card (its three
arms on one card); the pooled table per workload holds every card's repetitions (card c, repetition r is pooled as
repetition 100(c+1)+r) and is labelled by the same rule. Each card's own table is reported beside it; a card whose
table is invalid is reported, never dropped. The fault drill runs once, on the first card, after every card has
finished. Last, **one model across every card** (`scripts/gpu_vllm.sh` with GPU = every card): vLLM tensor parallel,
Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, one governor per card on its own card's two wires, all reading the same response times;
the energy is every card's summed; 5 repetitions × 3 arms × 300 s, labelled by the same rule. Each card's energy is read from that card alone (the bench's sampling filtered to the card in each
repetition's own receipt).

**The short design** (`FAST=1`, written before any trial on several cards): each card runs one smoke round and 3
repetitions of the compute confirmation (24 paired repetitions on 8 cards, pooled and labelled by the same rule, each
card's own table reported beside it), then one model across every card with 3 repetitions. AI token generation and the
power cap underneath are measured on the one-card machine (amendment 9) and are not repeated here.

**The whole stacks with a real card inside, on several cards** (written before any trial): `tools/run_hil.py` as on the
one-card machine (amendment 9, the six organisms at 1x, 10x, 100x and 1,000x, repetitions 3, 3, 2, 1 by size, the
adaptive step), each organism on its own card at the same time (organism i on card i; with fewer cards than
organisms, the next organism waits for a card). Each organism's receipt is its own; nothing is pooled across organisms.

**The pooled design** (`POOLED=1`, written before any trial on several cards): every stage of the whole design, with
the repetitions pooled across the cards. Each card runs one smoke round; 3 repetitions of the compute confirmation and
3 of the AI token generation confirmation (24 paired repetitions per test on 8 cards, pooled and labelled by the same
rule, each card's own table beside it); 2 repetitions of each power cap load (16 per load); the six organisms with the
card inside, one repetition per size, each organism on its own card; then one model across every card, 3 repetitions;
the fault drill once. Arm durations are those of the whole design.

**The time budget** (`MAX_HOURS`, written before any trial on several cards): a run on several cards ends by its
budget whatever happens. At the budget the master switch is pulled (every governor hands its card back), every stage
still measuring stops and is reported as incomplete (an arm cut short is never counted: its repetition has no complete
pair), the stages not started are skipped and named, and the finished ones are packed.


### Amendment 11 (2026-10-04, before any trial on this code)

The six organisms with the card inside (`tools/run_hil.py`), first run 2026-10-02 at commit `c908054`, labelled the
card's part SUPERIOR in five organisms while its 95th percentile rose from about 500 ms to 600-935 ms in every organism.
The harness counted the card's work and energy and never its response time (its time over the line was fixed at zero).
That run is history: its governor was replaced in amendments 6 and 7, and its labels do not meet the founder's rule.

From this amendment the card harness measures what it never counted:

- the card's time over the line (requests slower than the line, ten bare service times, percent of requests) and its
  95th percentile, each paired against native;
- each row keeps its preregistered label and names, beside it, every measure that came out worse than native by any
  amount, so what Omni costs is read beside what it gains; every change is read in words (better or WORSE, and what it
  means); no new line is drawn. The 2% bound stays where the founder set it: inside the engine, as the trigger of the
  verdict (`omnicompass/verdict.py`: a knob moves only where a paired trial shows the muscle at most 2% worse);
- the stacks' own label (`realms/harness.py label`) puts the band first: its guardrail is the mean time over the line
  at or under native's, where it was the upper end of the interval under +1 point;
- at one copy, each organism runs 5 paired repetitions (was 3), so an energy change of 1-3% on the card's own meter
  can be told from noise; 3, 2 and 1 at 10, 100 and 1,000 copies as before.

The single card and the eight cards run this code. A card run started before this amendment is reported in full from
its own raw files (its response times included) before any figure is quoted.

Why the stacks were late more often in the first run (+0.25 points) and are not now (-0.03): two knobs moved in commit
`2a9285d`. Omni could loosen the operator's HPA target to 0.95 (fewer pods, bursts wait); it is now held at the
operator's. A machine went back with no headroom (the next burst waits for a boot); it now goes back only when the rest
covers the recent peak at 0.6 of the release level. Each alone leaves the stacks late more often; together they are late
less often. The headroom is the least that keeps every seed un-late (`results/realms/RELEASE_MARGIN_SWEEP.md`).

Every report reads each change in words (better or WORSE, and what it means), so a sign is never read alone.

### Amendment 12 (2026-10-05, before any trial on this code)

The card model rerun on the current code (`tools/run_gpu_card.py`, 2026-10-05) showed amendment 9's steady hold making
the card slower on its own firmware: compute work, p95 122 ms native against 149 ms with Omni on top, time over the line
+0.39 points. A bisection over every commit since the last clean model run puts the change in commit `bd455f9`
(amendment 9, item 1). Holding the ceiling at the card's median busy clock takes away the boost the firmware uses to
serve a burst at its own factory limit. Under an operator's cap the same hold is what helps: the firmware sawtooths
against the low cap, and the hold smooths it.

From this amendment the hold applies only under an operator's cap: the start limit under the card's factory limit,
read from the card (`power.default_limit`). If the card will not say, it is treated as no cap, so no hold, and the
firmware is left to serve the burst. On the card's own limit, saturated, Omni races, as it did before amendment 9.
Test: `tests/test_gpu_compass.py` (no hold at the factory limit; the hold under a 150 W cap on a 214 W card).

The card model with this amendment, 20 seeds (tuning and fresh). Under the cap: p95 6.4% and 7.1% faster, p99 3.2% and
5.8% faster, time over the line 1.3 and 1.0 points lower. On the firmware: energy 0.5-3.7% lower, p95 even. The median
is 0.6-1.5% slower, inside the verdict's allowance (`results/sim/gpu_two_wire/`). The real card is the test.

## 45. The Realms Preregistration



Round 3 is the current one: its section at the end changes only how the realms are made up. Round 2's section
replaced round 1's Omni layer. Round 1 below is kept as it
was frozen. Each round was written and committed before its confirmation seeds were run. Evidence class **S**: every number the run produces
comes from a declared model. Nothing here is a meter, and nothing here is evidence about a real machine.

### Question

For each of the 656 muscles of the canonical tower, and for each realm and the whole tower run as one organism: does
the frozen governor (`omnicompass.adapter.Governor`, the engine with u = 0, the stack law, the reset), holding
that muscle's one knob on top of the plant's native controller, change work per energy against the native controller
alone, without buying it with service?

### What runs

- **The catalog** (`realms/catalog.csv`, built by `tools/realms_catalog.py`): the 656 rows of the XPASS package's
  canonical tower, unchanged, plus four columns given by fixed rules: realm, plant, parameter set, knob.
  - Compute / AI / Cloud: 250 muscles. Physics / Robotics / Autonomous: 88. Energy / Facility / Industrial: 121.
    Distribution / Specialized: 197.
- **Five plants** (`realms/plants.py`), each with its own native controller, all parameters in `realms/presets.py`:
  - compute_pool: request stream, servers with start-up delay, idle and dynamic power; native: the HPA rule
    (10% tolerance, scale-down stabilisation window), fixed admission limit, full clock;
  - thermal_zone: zone heat balance, staged cooling units, COP from supply and outdoor temperature; native: PI on a
    fixed setpoint, units staged to the load;
  - energy_storage: site load, solar, battery, grid connection with a contract limit; native: self-consumption above
    a fixed reserve;
  - motion_axis: point-to-point moves from a task queue, motor copper losses and heating, derating; native: PID with
    feedforward at full speed;
  - process_loop: first-order process with dead time, pump or heater power; native: PI on a fixed setpoint.
- **A muscle is one knob of one plant.** Omni holds only that knob: capacity (the adapter's capacity law for one
  plant), setpoint (inside a declared band: calm end at rho0, stress end at rho_min), power (the directive's power
  cap), or admission (native while change is permitted; while not, only what clears inside the service target, or
  the flexible share deferred or shed).
- **Each muscle's plant is sized** by a factor 0.6 to 1.4 drawn from its muscle id.

### Arms

On the same seed, so with the same demand, weather and disturbances:

- **native**: the plant and its native controller;
- **watch**: the governor reads every period and writes nothing;
- **omni**: the governor holds the knob; at 90% of the run it is killed and the knob returns to the native controller;
- **fixed_calm** (setpoint muscles only, descriptive): the native controller with the setpoint fixed at the band's
  calm end. It shows how much of a setpoint result the band alone gives.

Organisms: every plant of a realm (or all 656) on one 15 s clock for one hour. Plants are coupled:
- the electrical power of compute, motion and process plants is heat in the realm's thermal zones;
- the organism's load swing is load on its storage sites;
- the zones' temperature is the ambient every other plant reports.

One governor reads the organism's aggregate, and its one directive sets every muscle's knob.

### Seeds and repetitions

Confirmation seeds 1000 to 1009: ten paired seeds per muscle and per organism. Development used seeds 0 and 1 only.
Nothing from development seeds is reported.

### Outcomes

- **Primary**, per seed: (work_omni / work_native) / (energy_omni / energy_native) − 1. Work is in the plant's own
  units: requests, IT heat held in specification, site load served, moves completed, or product delivered in
  specification. For an organism, work is the mean over its plants of work_omni / work_native, and energy is total
  joules.
- **Guardrails**, both must hold:
  - work: the 95% interval of work_omni / work_native − 1 must not reach below −1%;
  - violations: the 95% interval of the change in the share of periods in violation must not reach above +1
    percentage point.

  Violation, per plant:
  - compute: response time over the service target, or a dropped request;
  - thermal: zone over its limit;
  - storage: grid import over the contract limit;
  - motion: tracking error over its bound, winding over temperature, or the oldest task waiting past its deadline;
  - process: the process variable outside its specification.
- **Label, by rule** (`realms/harness.py`, `label()`, the GPU bench's rule):
  - SUPERIOR WITHIN GUARDRAILS;
  - ENERGY IMPROVEMENT WITH SERVICE TRADEOFF;
  - NONINFERIOR / INCONCLUSIVE;
  - NOT ESTABLISHED;
  - WORSE;
  - INVALID.

### Invalid

A muscle or organism is labelled INVALID if, on any seed:
- the watch arm differs from native in any meter or writes anything;
- the omni arm writes after the kill;
- a knob is not back at its native value after the kill;
- any contrast is not finite.

### Recorded

Per muscle and organism:
- every per-seed contrast;
- writes per run;
- the native violation share;
- the fixed-setpoint comparison where it applies.

Per run: the commit, the seeds, and the fingerprints of the catalog, the engine, the governor and the whole frozen
tree (`RUN.json`, `SHA256SUMS.txt`). The confirmation refuses to run on uncommitted code.

### Changes made on the development seeds, before this freeze

The development runs found bugs and sizing faults. Each was fixed before the confirmation seeds were run:

- **The admission knob was inverted**: it admitted only what cleared the service target while change was permitted.
  Fixed to the declared rule.
- **The compute admission limit compared the queue limit with the period's arrivals** instead of the backlog left
  after the period's service. Fixed for native and Omni alike.
- **The capacity law did not clip the queue and load readings to [0, 2]**, as the adapter's `observe_vector` does.
  Fixed.
- **Thermal and process utilisation was measured against the uncapped capacity** while the power cap was held, so the
  power law's trim ratcheted to its floor. Fixed: utilisation of the capacity actually available.
- **Compute plants reported a heat proxy of my own.** Replaced by the live controller's own thermal model
  (`omni_controller/muscles.py`).
- **Thermal zones kept fixed cooling units while their IT load was scaled.** The large halls were under-provisioned,
  so the native controller overheated. Cooling now scales with the hall.
- **The flight axis's motor thermal resistance was ten times too high**, so the native controller was always derated.
  Corrected. The UPS feed was sized under its own load; sized at 1.2 times.
- **The slow plants** (vehicle, spacecraft, flight) completed too few tasks in six minutes to measure. They now decide
  every 5, 10 and 2 seconds over the same 360 decisions.
- **Added the fixed_calm arm** for setpoint muscles, after development showed that the band's calm end alone accounts
  for much of the setpoint results.

None of these changes was chosen by its effect on Omni's result. The development runs showed losses as well as gains
for Omni before and after them.

### Not claimed

- **No row is evidence about a real machine.** A row says what the governor's law does to that model through that
  knob.
- **The plants, native controllers and bands were written by the same project as the governor.** That is a real
  conflict, so every one of them is in two files, to be read and contested.
- **A muscle's name chooses its knob and its plant's size; it does not get its own physics.** The 16 muscles of a
  family share the family's plant model at different sizes, through different knobs.
- **The plant code is Python only.** The governor's C++ twin is unchanged; a C++ twin of the plants is open.

### Round 2 (2026-10-01, after round 1's results; before any round-2 confirmation seed)

Round 1 (seeds 1000-1009) labelled all five organisms WORSE. Reading the result against the shipped controller
(`omni_controller/controller.py`, `omni_controller/muscles.py`, `omnicompass/nervous_system.py`) showed that round 1's
Omni layer was not the Omni that runs on Kubernetes. Round 1 is kept unchanged in `results/realms/round1/`, with a note
saying why it is superseded. Round 2 changes only how Omni commands a knob, the native machine-pool scaler and the
declared budgets. These changes were made after seeing round 1, so they are listed with the source line each one follows:

| Round 1 | Round 2, as the shipped controller does it |
|---|---|
| Capacity muscles replaced the HPA with the stack simulator's capacity law (release one unit after convergence, dwell and a 20% band) | Pods: the HPA target written as min(rho*, the operator's target), never tighter, held one autoscaler window; the HPA scales (`controller.py`, HPA target patch). Machine pools: the node release gate, one machine per decision (`nervous_system.node_release_gate`) |
| HPA-type setpoints moved inside a band whose calm end was tighter than the operator's target | The same min(rho*, operator) rule: more headroom is always allowed, less never (`controller.py`) |
| No contraction authority and no SLO reflex | Every contraction needs the organ's authority (calm >= threshold, senses live) and three clean decisions; while service is breached the knob returns to native (`nervous_system.authority`, `muscles.py` SLO reflex) |
| Continuous knobs jumped to the governed value | Down by at most the calm share of the surplus per decision (`nervous_system`: step = calm) |
| Request-served pools had their power capped | Never: throttling request work saves no energy and adds wait (`muscles.py`, `_power_cap`); GPU and CPU-frequency pools use their envelope, never under draw x 1.3 |
| Thermal setpoint by headroom | The live cooling law: warm while cool, cold as heat rises, under the envelope 18 + 9 x calm mapped onto the band (`muscles.py`, `_cooling`) |
| Admission paused every admission muscle, request traffic included, and resumed only when fully calm | Batch pacing of pausable work only: one muscle suspended per decision at power stress >= 0.95 or heat >= 0.96 (or a nervous pause), one resumed per decision at power stress <= 0.8 and heat < 0.90 (`muscles.py`, `_batch_pace` defaults); request traffic never paused |
| queue_ratio was the backlog in service-target units | pending starts per serving unit, or latency pressure (p95 / target − 1, or the failed share), capped at 2 (`controller.py`) |
| The governor's current cap followed the applied cap | 1.0, as the live controller sets it |
| Site power budget 1.25 x a formula nominal that sat under the organism's real native draw (compute ran at 1.2 x it), so the governor read the site as always at its limit | 1.25 x each plant's mean native draw on the calibration seed 999 (never a result seed); compute pools alone likewise |
| Organism heat = the hottest of up to 656 plants | The mean, as every other organism channel; local heat stays with each plant's own reflex |
| Native machine pools used the HPA rule | The Cluster Autoscaler's defaults: add while work waits, remove one machine after the rest has been under 50% for 10 minutes |
| Building cooling sized under its own peak (native overheated half the time) | Units of 35 kW: capacity 1.25 x the declared peak |

Unchanged: the plants' physics, the catalog, every other parameter, the arms, the outcomes, the guardrails, the
label rule and the invalidity rules.

- **Round 2 seeds:** 2000 to 2009. Development of round 2 used seeds 0 and 1 only, never reported.
- **Results:** `results/realms/` (round 1 in `results/realms/round1/`). Both rounds are cited together.

### Round 3 (2026-10-02, after round 2's results; before any round-3 confirmation seed)

Only the make-up of the realm organisms changes. The plants, the Omni layer, the outcomes, the guardrails, the label
rule and the invalidity rules are round 2's, unchanged.

- **Round 2 cut the 656 into four realms with no overlap.** No realm organism carried the infrastructure every real
  stack runs on unless that infrastructure was the realm's own. The data-centre realm had no cooling or power, and
  the robotics and plant realms had no Kubernetes, machines or GPUs.
- **Round 3 gives every realm the shared spine** (`tools/realms_catalog.py`, SPINE): Kubernetes Workload Scaling,
  Placement & Scheduling, Container Resources, Node Fleet, Cloud VM & Capacity, NVIDIA GPU Hardware, Host CPU &
  Memory, Network Routing, Storage, Observability, Reliability & Security, Cooling & Chillers, PDU / UPS &
  Electrical Distribution.
  - Each realm's organism is its own families plus the spine: Compute 345 muscles, Physics 262, Energy 282,
    Distribution 337.
  - The whole-tower organism still holds each of the 656 once.
- **Quantum Computing Control moves to the compute realm** (it behaves as a compute job queue).
- **Round 3 seeds:** 3000 to 3009. Round 2 is kept in `results/realms/round2/` with a note on why it is superseded.

### Round 4: the stacked organism (2026-10-02, before any round-4 seed)

The four realm organisms of round 3, stacked on one 15 s clock (`realms/harness.py`, `run_stack`; `tools/run_stack.py`).
Every muscle appears as often as it appears in the realms, duplicates included: 345 + 262 + 282 + 337 = 1,226. A
duplicate is still a muscle that has to converge. Each realm keeps its own internal coupling. The plants, the Omni
layer, the outcomes, the guardrails and the label rule are round 3's.

- **Arms:** native (no governor); separate (one governor per realm); one (one governor over the whole stack, reading
  the mean of all 1,226 muscles and the stack's total power against its total budget).
- **Check, required for validity:** the stacked native run equals each realm's own native run, plant by plant, on
  every seed. Stacking must change nothing natively.
- **Comparisons, each labelled by the rule:**
  - one governor against native;
  - separate governors against native;
  - one governor against separate governors (does one Omni over everything beat four).
- **Seeds:** 4000 to 4009. Development used seed 0 only, never reported.

### Round 5: the whole stacks with the real card inside (written 2026-10-02, before any run)

One harness (`tools/run_hil.py`, started by `scripts/gpu_rented_run.sh` after a valid card smoke): each of the six
organisms (the four realms, the four stacked with every duplicate kept (1,226), the whole tower of 656) runs on one clock as in round 3, with the machine's real GPU wired
in as one more muscle of its NVIDIA GPU family (a spine family, so the card is in every organism). The card serves the
pinned request stream; its own power.draw is heat in the organism's thermal zones and load on its storage sites.

- **Arms:** native (the stacks' own controllers, the card's own firmware) and omni (one engine on everything: the compass
  law on every simulated muscle, `realms/compass_arm.py`, and on the card's two wires, `omni_controller/gpu_compass.py`). At
  90% of each arm every knob and both wires are handed back; a knob not handed back, a card limit not back at its
  start, or a card governor exiting non-zero makes the run invalid (exit 2).
- **Seeds and repetitions:** 3 paired repetitions, seeds 6000-6002; arm order alternates by repetition and organism.
- **Clock:** 240 steps of 2 s of wall clock per arm (the card in real time).
- **Outcomes:** work per energy, work, energy and violations, Omni against native, for three parts kept apart: the
  simulated stacks (evidence S), the card (its own meter, evidence P), and both added (the card as one more plant,
  its joules added to the stacks'). Labels by the round 3 rule.

### Round 6: the compute pools inside the band (2026-10-03, before any round-6 seed)

Round 3's rule (band first) was not held on the organisms: the compass law spent 0.20 to 0.29 points more time over the
service line than native in every completed cell of the grid (`results/scale/GRID.md`). The cause was measured on the
whole tower (seeds 7000-7003), muscle by muscle:
- **compute pools giving a machine back** (42 muscles): +1.77 points of their own time over the line;
- **the HPA target set looser than the operator's** (249 muscles): +0.22 points;
- the process and thermal setpoints, which save the most energy, added none.

Two changes, both in `realms/compass_arm.py`, everything else as round 3:
1. **The HPA target is held at the operator's own.** Loosening it past native costs the service time. This is the same
   rule as the card's speed floor and the live controller's cover.
2. **A machine goes back only when the machines left cover the recent peak at 0.6 of the plant's own release level**
   (`RELEASE_MARGIN`). A machine boots in minutes, so a burst that arrives after a release is served late until the
   machine is back.

**How 0.6 was chosen** (10 paired seeds per organism; the rule is the most work per energy whose whole interval of time
over the line is at or under native): 1.0, 0.8, 0.75, 0.7, 0.65 and 0.6 on the tower; 0.65 and 0.6 on the other five.
- 0.65 failed on Physics, the upper end of its interval +0.001;
- 0.6 held on all six.

**Checked on 20 paired seeds (7000-7019), before this round's official seeds:**

| Organism | Work per energy | Time over the line | Work done |
|---|---|---|---|
| Compute | +0.095% | −0.017 pp | unchanged within its interval (−0.001% to +0.000%) |
| Physics | +0.086% | −0.011 pp | unchanged within its interval (−0.001% to +0.000%) |
| Energy | +0.201% | −0.031 pp | unchanged within its interval (−0.001% to +0.000%) |
| Distribution | +0.090% | −0.015 pp | unchanged within its interval (−0.001% to +0.000%) |
| The four stacked | +0.153% | −0.022 pp | unchanged within its interval (−0.001% to +0.000%) |
| The whole tower | +0.194% | −0.010 pp | unchanged within its interval (−0.001% to +0.000%) |

Every knob was handed back. The grid runs at 100× and 1,000× now on GitHub were started on round 3's law. They are
recorded as round 3's result, and the grid is rerun on round 6's law.

### Round 5, amended (2026-10-03, before any round-5 run on the corrected law)

The whole stacks with the real card inside run at four sizes, as the six-organism grid does: each organism as 1, 10, 100
and 1,000 copies governed together on one clock, with the one real card inside as one more muscle of its NVIDIA GPU
family, native against Omni on top. Repetitions by size: 3, 3, 2 and 1 (seeds from 6000).

The step is 2 s of wall clock wherever the simulation keeps up. A size whose step takes longer gets a longer step:
1.5 times the measured time per muscle on that machine, times its muscles. The card's request stream runs for the same
240 steps, so the card and the stacks stay on one clock. The step of every size is in the receipt. At 1,000 copies the
card is one muscle among hundreds of thousands, so its watts are a small share of the organism's; that is the
arithmetic of one card in a large stack, and the card's own meter is reported apart from the stacks. Everything else is
as round 5. The two GPU confirmations now run before this stage, so the most important results are in hand first.

### Round 6 receipts and the one rule (2026-10-03)

At 1x and 10x (1,000 paired runs each) every organism is labelled superior within guardrails, with band first held and
every knob handed back (`results/scale/receipts/`, `results/scale/GRID.md`). At 1,000 runs the intervals are narrow
enough to show one cost: work done is lower by 0.0001% to 0.001%, wholly below zero in several organisms. Its cause was
measured on the Physics organism, muscle by muscle. It is the thermal zones: a room held warmer keeps a little less
margin, so a sudden heat spike puts it over its limit for a few extra seconds inside a step that already counts as
over the line.

Limiting how far a room may drift (half, a quarter, none of the way toward its warm end; 40 paired seeds) does not
remove it until the setpoint is held native, and then the Physics organism uses more energy than native. The cost is
therefore disclosed and judged by the one rule now written for every muscle (`DISCLOSURES.md`, section 3): at most 2% in
any measure, only where energy is saved. The largest work cost in the grid is 0.007% in a single run and 0.001% over
1,000 runs, far inside it.

#### The 1,000-copy size: memory and sharding (2026-10-03, before its re-run)

The first 1,000-copy run (six run 37090435347) stopped twice at the same point: every organism larger than physics
and robotics ran out of memory about 3 minutes in (the four stacked at 1,000 copies is 1.2 million plants; at 33 KB a
plant, and with the calibration organism built while the result organism was still held, it needed over 40 GB on a
16 GB runner). Three changes, none of which changes a number:
- the calibration run is made before the organism, so one organism is in memory at a time (`realms/harness.py`, `Body`);
- each plant is packed as it is made: its exogenous series as machine arrays, its random source dropped (every plant
  draws its series when it is made, never while it runs), plants with the same parameters sharing one table
  (`realms/plants.py`, `pack`, `_shared`);
- the six workflow sizes its shards by organism (`per_shard`, `workers` by organism), because one run of the four
  stacked at 1,000 copies takes 2 to 3 hours and a runner's job ends at 6.

Same outputs: four organisms, two seeds each, at 1x to 3x, byte-identical before and after. A plant now takes 6.7 KB;
the four stacked at 1,000 copies needs about 9 GB. The re-run: 10 runs per organism at 1,000 copies (the 1-run and
10-run cells); 100 runs at 1,000 copies follows when the runners allow it (about 650 runner-hours).

The 100-run cells at 1,000 copies run on one rented machine (`scripts/grid_one_machine.sh`): every organism in turn,
as many processes as the machine's cores and memory allow, the same seeds (7000 on), each finished organism saved at
once, one receipt at the end (`SIX-1000x.md`), saved as `results/scale/v1/receipts/round6-1000x.md` in place of the
1-run and 10-run receipt it contains.

### Amendment (2026-10-05): the compass law is the arm, written before its run

The tables of round 3 compared native against the allocation law ("omni"), the arm that came before the compass law.
The engine is now one law on everything, the compass law on top of native, so the realms runner compares native against
compass (`realms/harness.py` ARMS: native, watch, compass). The watch arm stays: Omni watching must write nothing and
leave every muscle exactly as native. Seeds, plants, knobs, guardrails and the labelling rule are unchanged. The tables
published until now describe the allocation law and stay as first measured in `docs/history/`.

### Amendment (2026-10-05): four levers bounded by their physics, and the mirror label (written after the compass table was seen)

Disclosed: written after the first compass-law table (nine muscles WORSE) was seen. Each change follows from the muscle's
own model (`docs/MECHANISM_OF_ACTION.md` 9.6), applies to every muscle of its kind, and is tested:
1. Cooling power is native. A cap moves heat removal later, never away, and stages more units.
2. A battery's reserve is spent only at the connection's wall, and only when the battery can cover the excess. Below
   the operator's reserve every kWh costs (1 - eta)/sqrt(eta) to buy back.
3. A backup reserve (the UPS preset, `backup=True`) is never a lever.
4. A compute pool's power cap moves only where (9.8) says a lower cap saves energy. A quantum computer, a network switch
   and storage are left native (race to idle).

The labelling rule gains the mirror of ENERGY IMPROVEMENT WITH SERVICE TRADEOFF: less work per energy, no work lost
(at most 1%), and the time over the line proven lower is SERVICE IMPROVEMENT WITH ENERGY TRADEOFF. Everything else is as
before, and every other label keeps its definition.

Also in this amendment: an effort cap on a motion axis moves only where the copper loss it saves at full acceleration,
(J a_max / kt)^2 R, exceeds the standing draw a longer move pays, p_idle + b v_max^2 (a reaction wheel; not traction, a
flight axis or a robot joint). The machine-release margin on node pools is 0.3, the largest at which no pool is later than
native (`results/realms/RELEASE_MARGIN_SWEEP.md`, the per-muscle sweep).

### Omni v2: the catalog grows to 945 muscles in 59 families (2026-10-06, before any v2 seed)

Written before any counted v2 run. **The law, the controllers, the plants, the Omni layer, the outcomes, the guardrails,
the label rule and the invalidity rules are v1's, byte for byte.** Only the catalog and the presets it needs change, so by
the change rule of `docs/OMNI_V1.md` this is a new version, Omni v2 (`OMNI_V2.json`, `docs/OMNI_V2.md`), and every
modelled result is run again on it. No v1 result is read as a v2 result.

What is added, each row with its real system, its setting and its source, built by `tools/realms_catalog_v2.py` from three
committed files by the v1 rules (realm, membership, plant, preset and knob: `tools/realms_catalog.py`, unchanged):

- **The 656 of v1, byte for byte** (`realms/catalog_v1.csv`): every v1 muscle keeps its id, realm, plant, preset and knob.
- **118 real controls the realm study had already found and the tower lacked** (`docs/realm_study/TRUE_MUSCLES.csv`,
  the rows marked "added (real, not in the 656)"; six of them were already in the tower under another name and are
  listed as skipped in `realms/catalog_provenance.json`). They join the family the study filed them under; 70 of them
  are spine muscles (Kubernetes, nodes, hosts, GPUs, storage, network, observability, power, cooling) and so sit in all
  four realms.
- **171 muscles in thirteen new families** (`realms/wave4_families.csv`), the domains the tower did not cover, one new
  preset each (`realms/presets.py`, round engineering figures for the class of machine, as every other preset):

| Family | Realm | Plant / preset | Muscles | Examples of the real system |
|---|---|---|---:|---|
| Healthcare Critical Environments | Energy / Facility / Industrial | thermal_zone / hospital | 13 | ASHRAE 170 rooms on a hospital BMS (Metasys, Desigo); isolation-room pressure; pharmacy cold rooms |
| Medical Imaging & Clinical Systems | Distribution / Specialized | compute_pool / clinical | 12 | DICOM archives and routers (Orthanc, dcm4chee), EHR tiers, HL7/FHIR engines, monitoring gateways |
| Agriculture & Irrigation | Energy / Facility / Industrial | process_loop / irrigation | 14 | pivot and pump controllers (Valley, Lindsay, Netafim), greenhouse climate computers (Priva), grain dryers |
| Oil & Gas Pipelines | Energy / Facility / Industrial | process_loop / pipeline | 14 | compressor and pump station SCADA (Emerson, AVEVA, Honeywell), API 1130 leak detection, DRA injection |
| Rail Traction & Train Control | Physics / Robotics / Autonomous | motion_axis / rail_traction | 14 | traction converters and ATO (Siemens Mobility, Alstom, Hitachi Rail), CBTC headway, ERTMS |
| Marine Propulsion & Vessel Automation | Physics / Robotics / Autonomous | motion_axis / marine_propulsion | 12 | propulsion and power management (Kongsberg, Wärtsilä, MAN), IMO shaft power limitation |
| Ports & Maritime Logistics | Distribution / Specialized | compute_pool / port | 12 | terminal operating systems (Navis N4), automated cranes and AGVs (Kalmar, Konecranes), shore power |
| Mining & Mineral Processing | Energy / Facility / Industrial | process_loop / mill | 14 | grinding and flotation control (Metso, FLSmidth, ABB), ventilation on demand (Howden), dewatering |
| District Heating & Cooling | Energy / Facility / Industrial | process_loop / district_heat | 13 | network and substation control (Danfoss Leanheat, Kamstrup), CHP dispatch, thermal storage |
| Power Generation & Turbine Control | Energy / Facility / Industrial | process_loop / turbine | 14 | governors and plant DCS (GE Mark VIe, Emerson Ovation, Woodward), AVRs, hydro gates, reactor rods |
| Renewable Generation & Inverter Control | Energy / Facility / Industrial | process_loop / inverter | 13 | IEEE 1547 inverter curves (SMA, Enphase), wake steering (NREL FLORIS), pitch and curtailment (Vestas) |
| Elevators & Vertical Transport | Physics / Robotics / Autonomous | motion_axis / elevator_hoist | 12 | drives and destination dispatch (Otis, KONE, Schindler), ISO 25745 standby modes |
| Pharmaceutical & Food Manufacturing | Energy / Facility / Industrial | process_loop / batch_reactor | 14 | ISA-88 batch control (DeltaV, SIMATIC Batch), bioreactors (Sartorius), pasteurizers, CIP, cleanrooms |

Four wave-4 names collided with the tower and carry a domain prefix (`terminal_tank_level_target`,
`train_auxiliary_power_budget`, `plant_reactive_power_target`, `inverter_frequency_droop_setpoint`). Eleven names the knob
rules would have placed wrongly are set by hand in `tools/realms_catalog.py` OVERRIDE and listed there.

The organisms of v2: Compute / AI / Cloud 430, Physics / Robotics / Autonomous 376, Energy / Facility / Industrial 470,
Distribution / Specialized 440, the four stacked 1,716, the whole tower 945; the shared spine is 257 muscles. In code and
workflows the two whole-tower organisms are now named `tower` and `stack` (nothing is named by a count); the v1 names
`organism_656` and `stack_1226` are read as aliases, so every v1 run folder and record still reads.

Checked before this freeze, on seed 7, every one of the 289 added muscles: deterministic, the watch arm equal to native,
every knob handed back after the kill, no number undefined, Omni's time over the line never above native's. Two presets
were adjusted on that check and before any counted run: the inverter plant's disturbance amplitude (0.8 to 0.5, with its
noise 0.05 to 0.02) because native itself was outside its band a quarter of the time, and the elevator hoist's position
gains (kp 2,000 to 3,000, kd 400 to 500) with a smaller load disturbance (400 to 100 N m), because the first figures
put native's tracking error at its limit under passenger load. Where native is still often outside its band in some
heavy-load muscles (the compute pools at their busiest sizes), that is the plant at the size the muscle id draws, the
same for both arms, and it is reported as it comes.

v2 runs: the realms table (every muscle alone and the five organisms, seeds 3000-3009, three GitHub runs A, B, C), the
six-organism grid at 1, 10, 100 and 1,000 copies, the six organisms with the real cluster inside, and the big organisms
on Azure, each on the v2 fingerprint; the live benchmarks that import none of the realm files (Kubernetes alone, Azure
alone, CityLearn, the grid, the robots, the database) are run again on v2 as GitHub's queue allows, their v1 tables kept
as v1 tables.

### Omni v3: the slack gate on speed knobs (2026-10-06, after the v2 table, before any v3 seed)

Declared on the v2 result and before any v3 run. The v2 table (`results/realms/REALMS.md`, three runs reproduced) read
Physics and the whole tower as "energy improvement with a service tradeoff" where v1 had every organism superior. The rows
that carried it were the new speed muscles: three rail traction muscles where Omni's slowing added 1.6 to 2.7 points of
lateness on a train already near its timetable's capacity, and two marine and two elevator muscles where the slower cycle
finished fewer moves in the hour. By the honesty rule the first suspect was our own wiring, and it was: the realm
harness had no do-no-harm gate on the speed knob of a motion axis, so the compass slowed an axis that had no slack to
spend. The robot benchmark has such a gate (its paired physics trial, `docs/ROBOTICS_PREREGISTRATION.md`); the realms
get one now.

**The rule (`realms/compass_arm.py`, `speed_slack`).** A motion axis is offered its speed knob only where its duty at full
speed, task rate × (move time at full speed + dwell), is at most SLACK = 0.5, computed from the plant's own figures before
any decision. The compass may ease an axis down to 0.4 of its speed, which stretches a move by up to 2.5 times; an axis
busy more than half the time at full speed cannot absorb that when tasks arrive in bunches, and its knob stays native.
Where the knob is offered, nothing else changes: the compass, its gains, the cover [0.4, 1.0] and the fail-up are v2's.

**The marine preset.** Four 600 rad speed changes an hour made a one-hour run too coarse to count (one unfinished move
is a quarter of the hour's work); the v3 preset is twelve changes of 200 rad an hour, a move of 126 s plus 30 s of dwell,
deadline 1,200 s. No other preset changes.

**What the gate does on the shipped presets (the middle size; a muscle's own size, 0.6 to 1.4 on the task rate, moves
its duty either side):**

| Preset | Move at full speed | Dwell | A task every | Duty | The speed knob |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| flight axis | 4.8 s | 2.0 s | 20 s | 0.34 | offered |
| reaction wheel | 30.0 s | 5.0 s | 100 s | 0.35 | offered |
| marine propulsion | 126.5 s | 30 s | 300 s | 0.52 | left native |
| elevator hoist | 12.8 s | 8.0 s | 40 s | 0.52 | left native |
| robot joint | 0.7 s | 0.2 s | 1.7 s | 0.54 | left native at the middle size, offered on the lightly loaded joints |
| EV traction | 35.6 s | 10 s | 60 s | 0.76 | left native |
| rail traction | 220 s | 20 s | 300 s | 0.80 | left native |

The threshold is a declared number set on the v2 finding, not a fitted one: it is written here before the v3 runs and
applies to every axis alike. Where it leaves a knob native the row will read as native does, and that is the result.
Everything else, the plants, the outcomes, the guardrails, the label rule and the invalidity rules, is v2's. v3 runs the
realms table three times (A, B, C), then the grid, then the organisms with the real cluster inside; the v2 table stays a
v2 result.

## 46. The Compass Law on Real Kubernetes: Preregistration



Written and committed before the run. The run's commit is the one that carries this file; nothing in the law, the
harness or this rule changes after it starts.

### What is run

Workflow `benchmark-reps` on `main`, 10 repetitions. Each repetition runs three arms back to back on the same runner,
each on a fresh six-worker kind cluster, in an order rotated by repetition (`scripts/kind_paired.sh`):

| Arm | What governs |
|---|---|
| native | Kubernetes alone (HPA at target 50, scheduler); Omni-Compass not started |
| omni | Omni-Compass on top with the engine's allocation law (`--law governor`, the law of sets 22 to 25) |
| compass | Omni-Compass on top with the compass law (`--law compass`, `omni_controller/controller.py`) |

Load: fixed rate (`loadgen=open`), the same work in every arm. 900 measured seconds per arm. SLO 500 ms at the 95th
percentile. Every Omni arm runs the six-state engine on every decision, the nervous system's authority and release
gate, the shield, the compass, and ends with the reset, which must return the HPA target, its replica range,
the pods' CPU limits and every worker to native, with no record left (`scripts/kind_bench.sh`).

### The compass law in the live controller

The service position is the 95th-percentile response time over the SLO (0 calm, 1 the line); a blind probe or a pod
waiting for a place reads as past the wall. The force is `A tanh((K_P (p - 0.5) + K_D v) / A)` with K_D for critical
damping times the realm push factor 3, the same law and gains as on every realm muscle (`realms/compass_arm.py`):
up gain 0.10, down gain 0.02, release threshold -0.2. Two levers:

1. **HPA target**, cover from 60% of the operator's target to the operator's own: the up force lowers it (more pods),
   the down force returns it toward the operator's. It is never tighter than native.
2. **Node pool**: past the 0.95 wall one machine more at once; one machine back only while the force is below -0.2,
   the position is below the center, and the nervous system's release gate is open.

### Outcomes and the rule

Primary: **worker nodes in service** (mean) and **95th-percentile response time**, each arm against native, paired
over the 10 repetitions with a t-based 95% interval (`tools/live_reps.py`).

Band first: the compass arm is a win only if its p95 is not worse than native's (the upper end of the 95% interval of the
paired difference at or under 0) **and** failed requests are not higher. If that holds and machines in service fall
with an interval wholly below 0, the label is **better on machines within the band**. If machines fall but the band
condition fails, the label is **tradeoff**. Otherwise **not established**.

Secondary, reported, not used for the label: p99, mean response time, HPA replicas, pods started, pod start wait, CPU
including Omni-Compass's own, the declared energy models. The omni arm is reported against native and against the
compass arm by the same rule. A run that fails its own checks (reset, controller stopped early, missing permission)
is marked invalid and left out, never silently counted.

Evidence class **L**: real Kubernetes software on kind. Energy on kind is a declared model, not a meter.

### Set 26 result

Compass arm against native: machines in service -17.2% (-26.4% to -7.9% of native), p95 -64.8%, failed requests 0 on
both: **better on machines within the band** (`results/live/LIVE_REPS_26.md`). The allocation law in the same set:
machines -35.8%, p95 -55.4%.

### Set 27 (written before the run)

The compass in the live controller now reads the service as the GPU compass does (`omni_controller/gpu_compass.py`, GPU
amendments 6 and 7): the mean response time of the latency window between the bare service time (a tenth of the SLO)
and the SLO, held at the compass's center 0.4 (the GPU service profile); p95 at or past the SLO, a blind probe or a pod
waiting for a place is past the wall. Everything else, the arms (native, omni, compass), the load, the duration, the
outcomes and the labelling rule above, is unchanged. The run's commit is the one that carries this section.

### Set 27 result

Compass arm, aligned with the GPU governor, against native: machines in service -15.9% (-1.462 to -0.450 machines),
p95 -65.5% (-311.8 to -156.1 ms), p99 -72.6%, failed requests 0 on both: **better on machines within the band**
(`results/live/LIVE_REPS_27.md`, run 37071353971, commit `d46c959`). The allocation law in the same set: machines
-36.6%, p95 -53.1%.

### The verdict in the live controller (2026-10-03, before any further set)

The compass law gives a machine back only where it measures that the service is no worse for it
(`omnicompass/verdict.py`, stepwise, in `omni_controller/controller.py`). While the service is calm (inside the compass,
no pod waiting, no breach), one more machine is given back on trial. The response times of 200 requests served without
it are set against 200 served just before and against the cluster as it first ran on its own:
- at most 2% slower than both: the machine stays given back;
- slower than that: it is taken back and not tried again for 120 decisions.

Where no machine passes, the pool stays as the cluster runs it alone. The HPA target's cover is unchanged: from 60% of
the operator's target up to the operator's own, never looser than native. Every trial is in the audit. The next set
runs with this verdict; sets 26 and 27 ran before it and stay as they ran.

### Set 28 and set 29 (2026-10-03, set 29 written before its run)

Set 28 (run 37087620193, commit `24666d7`) ran the compass law with the verdict. With Omni-Compass on top against native:
- machines in service −4.7%;
- p95 −65.3%, p99 −68.6%;
- pods waiting 0;
- failed requests 0.

Total CPU including Omni-Compass's own came out **+2.2%** (+0.003 to +0.042 cores), more than the 2% the one rule
allows (`DISCLOSURES.md`, section 3). The cause is the controller's own cost: 0.063 cores, mostly a new kubectl process
for every read, about 20 a minute. The compass law with the verdict freed only 0.040 cores of work. The allocation law in
the same set: machines −29.6%, p95 −58.0%, total CPU including its own −1.2% (not significant). Set 28's receipt is
`results/live/LIVE_REPS_28.md`, published with this section.

**Set 29** runs the same arms, load, duration, outcomes and rule as set 28. One thing changes: the controller reads
through one `kubectl proxy` started once, under the same least-privilege identity, so a read is a local HTTP request
instead of a new kubectl process (`omni_controller/controller.py`, `Kube`; writes are unchanged; `tests/test_api_proxy.py`).
The label also requires total CPU including Omni-Compass's own to be no more than 2% above native.

Set 29 result (run 37094338955, commit `a3721cc`): the compass law with the verdict, total CPU including its own **−4.7%**
(−0.071 to −0.017 cores), passes; Omni-Compass's own CPU 0.011 cores (set 28: 0.063). Machines −5.1%, p95 −64.4%,
p99 −71.1%, HPA replicas −7.6%, failed requests 0. No measure significantly worse than native in either arm. Receipt:
`results/live/LIVE_REPS_29.md`.

### The cost to match (written before its run)

The question a buyer asks: what would native Kubernetes have to spend to answer as fast as it does with Omni-Compass on
top? Each repetition runs, on the same runner and the same work, in rotated order:
- native (the operator's HPA target 50);
- native tuned harder by its operator, HPA target 40, 30 and 20 (more pods, faster answers), no Omni-Compass (`ARM=native40`, `native30`, `native20` in `scripts/kind_bench.sh`);
- native with Omni-Compass on top, the allocation law (`omni`);
- native with Omni-Compass on top, the compass law with the verdict (`compass`).

The report (`tools/live_reps.py`, "The cost to match") lists every arm's p95, p99, HPA replicas, CPU including
Omni-Compass's own, and machines in service. For each Omni-Compass arm it names the cheapest native setting (by CPU)
whose p95 is at or under Omni-Compass's, and that setting's extra replicas, CPU and machines over Omni-Compass. If no
native setting tried reaches it, the report says so and gives the lowest native p95. 10 repetitions, 900 measured
seconds per arm, fixed-rate load.

### The fault test (written before its run)

Health, security and the babysitting a cluster needs, measured. Every arm (native; native with Omni-Compass on top,
the allocation law; native with Omni-Compass on top, the compass law with the verdict) meets the same four faults at the
same moments (`scripts/kind_faults.sh`, `FAULTS=1`):
1. at 15% of the run, a worker machine dies (its kind container is stopped) and comes back two minutes later;
2. at 35%, traffic triples for two minutes;
3. at 55%, a pod with no CPU limit burns CPU for two minutes;
4. at 75%, the response-time probe goes blind for one minute.

For each fault the report (`tools/live_reps.py`, "The fault test") gives the time to recover (from the fault's start
until responses stay under the line for 30 s straight, at most 300 s) and the share of samples over the line or failed
in the 300 s after it, paired against native over 10 repetitions. All the usual gauges are reported as well, now
including the share of response samples over the line (`pilot/bench_report.py`). Lower is better in each.

**The fault test, first run** (run 37094604580, commit `a149d4e`; `results/live/FAULTS.md`). Omni-Compass on top
recovered faster than native from every fault (allocation law: machine down −29%, runaway pod −35%, spike −7%; compass
law: −14%, −17%, −6%), p95 −53% and −55%, p99 −27% (not significant) and −57%. One measure was worse: with the compass law,
**HPA replicas +8.2%** (+0.41 to +0.99, significant), with CPU and machines unchanged and no energy saved, so outside
the one rule (`DISCLOSURES.md`, section 3). The cause: past the wall the compass lowers the HPA target at once (more pods,
the faster recovery), then handed the operator's target back step by step and held each step for the autoscaler's
window, so the extra pods outlived the fault.

**The change, written before the re-run** (`omni_controller/controller.py`, the compass's push and pull on the HPA target;
`tests/test_compass_controller.py`, "fault over"): once the responses are back inside the band (the compass's position under
its center), the response line is clean and no pod is waiting, the operator's own target returns at once and is not
held by the window. More pods only while the fault lasts. The re-run is the same fault test, arms, load, duration and
rule (set 30 F); set 30 runs the same code without faults, to show nothing else moved.

**Set 30 and set 30 F** (runs 37105047258 and 37105046042, commit `acc1c4e`; `results/live/LIVE_REPS_30.md`,
`results/live/FAULTS_30.md`). Set 30, no faults: nothing significantly worse in either arm; the compass law's machines
−9.9%, p95 −64.9%, time over the line −98.7%, HPA replicas −32.2%, total CPU −6.5%. Set 30 F: recovery faster than native
from every fault in both arms; the compass law's HPA replicas **+5.6%** (first run +8.2%), still significant, with CPU and
machines unchanged. The allocation law, which recovers as fast or faster, held no extra pods (+2.0%, not significant).

**The second change, written before set 31 F** (`omni_controller/controller.py`; `tests/test_compass_controller.py`,
"blind"). Past the wall, the compass lowers the HPA target (more pods) only when the cause is load: the response line
breached with every sense live and no pod waiting. Past the wall from a blind sense, or from pods waiting for a machine
that is gone, more pods answer neither, so the target is the operator's own: fail up is native's own setting, as on the
card, where fail up is the card's own clock and limit. The machine reflex (one machine more past the wall) is unchanged.
Set 31 F is the same fault test, arms, load, duration and rule; set 31 the same without faults.

**Set 31 and set 31 F** (runs 37110007121 and 37110005322, commit `0a38e76`; `results/live/LIVE_REPS_31.md`,
`results/live/FAULTS_31.md`). Set 31 F: the compass law's HPA replicas under faults **−1.1%** (not significant): the extra
pods are gone. Nothing significantly worse in either arm; recovery faster than native from every fault (compass law,
machine down −49%). Set 31: nothing significantly worse; the compass law's machines −10.4%, p95 −66.0%, p99 −73.0%, time over
the line −99.4%, HPA replicas −44.5%, pods started 0 against native's 4.3, total CPU −6.1%.

### The bill on a real cloud (written before its run)

The question a buyer pays for: the same work, a smaller bill? On kind every machine stays powered, so a machine given
back saves only a declared model's energy. On a real cloud the machine is deleted and stops being billed. The run
(`.github/workflows/aks-metered.yml`, `scripts/aks_paired.sh`, `scripts/kind_bench.sh` with `PLATFORM=aks`):

- **The cluster.** Azure Kubernetes Service, a fresh cluster for every arm, built the same way:
  - a system pool of one machine, tainted so no workload lands on it (AKS's add-ons and the load generator: kind's
    control plane);
  - a work pool starting at 4 machines (Standard_D2s_v5) under **Azure's own cluster autoscaler** (min 1, max 4; scale
    down after 2 minutes unneeded), which deletes a machine once it is empty.
- **The arms**, rotated in each repetition:
  - native: Kubernetes with Azure's autoscaler alone;
  - native with Omni-Compass on top, the compass law with the verdict (`compass`);
  - native with Omni-Compass on top, the allocation law (`omni`).

  With Omni-Compass on top, the machines it gives back are idled (new pods go elsewhere, their pods leave first), and
  Azure's autoscaler then deletes them. Omni-Compass never deletes a machine itself.
- **The same work** in every arm: the fixed-rate load of sets 22 onward, 900 measured seconds after 120 s of warm-up.
- **The bill.** Every 15 s, the number of work machines that exist (in service or idle, every one is billed),
  integrated over the measured window: billed machine-hours, priced at Azure's list price for the machine
  (USD 0.096 an hour for Standard_D2s_v5, Linux, pay as you go, set in the workflow's input). Omni-Compass never reads
  this count.
- **Outcomes.** Billed machine-hours and the bill (lower is better), and every gauge of sets 28 and 29 (response time,
  failures, pods waiting, CPU including Omni-Compass's own), paired against native with 95% intervals over 5
  repetitions. Labelled by the one rule (`DISCLOSURES.md`, section 3): nothing more than 2% worse, and only where the
  bill or energy is saved.
- **Housekeeping.** One repetition at a time; each cluster deleted when its arm ends, before the next is made; the
  resource group deleted at the end of every repetition whatever happens. It needs the repository secret
  `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`.

### The capacity test (written before its run)

The question behind "more work for the same cost": on the same machines, how much more work does Kubernetes serve
with Omni-Compass on top before its answers break the line? Each repetition runs native, native with Omni-Compass on
top (the allocation law) and with the compass law and the verdict, in rotated order, on the same six workers, the
open-loop load rising in eight equal steps of one load generator each (6 requests a second per generator, 1 to 8
generators, 200 s a step, 1,600 measured seconds; `load_steps` in `benchmark-reps`). A run's capacity is the highest
step at which no more than 5% of the response samples (every 5 s, through the Service) are over the line (500 ms) or
failed, every lower step holding too, the first 30 s of each step left to settle (`tools/live_reps.py`, `capacity`).
Reported: each arm's mean capacity in requests a second, its change against native and the 95% interval of the paired
difference over 10 repetitions; every usual gauge beside it. Labelled by the one rule: nothing more than 2% worse.


### The fairness test (written before its run)

The question a buyer with many tenants asks: when one application surges, does Omni-Compass on top protect its
neighbour, or starve it? Each repetition runs native, native with Omni-Compass on top (the allocation law) and with the
compass law and the verdict, in rotated order, on the same six workers, with two applications on them (`TWO_APP=1`,
`deploy/kind/noisy.yaml`): php-apache under its usual fixed-rate load, and a noisy neighbour, the same image and the
same HPA rule, whose own fixed-rate load surges in steps (0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0 load generators of 6 requests a second, the
same moments in every arm). Each application's response time is probed through its own Service. Omni-Compass governs
both HPAs (`deploy/kind/rbac-omni-noisy.yaml`: the second HPA and nothing else more). Reported: every usual gauge for
php-apache, and the neighbour's p95, p99, time over the line and failed requests, each paired against native over 10
repetitions with its 95% interval. The label is the one rule, applied to both applications: nothing more than 2% worse
for either.

### The capacity and fairness results, and the amendment they call for (2026-10-03 evening, before either is run again)

**Capacity** (`results/live/CAPACITY.md`, run 37150909816): the compass law served 33.0 requests a second within the line
against native's 24.6, **+34.1% (95% interval of the paired difference +6.2 to +10.6 requests a second)**, with
response times about half of native's and fewer failures. One measure significantly worse: pods started 7.3 against
5.6 (+30.4%) while the mean HPA replicas were 26.9% lower: churn, not more pods. **Fairness**
(`results/live/FAIRNESS.md`, run 37154210570): the neighbour unharmed under both laws; with the compass law php-apache's
failed requests 3.89% to 4.90% (+0.12 to +1.90 points), pending pods and pod start wait worse, no machine saved. By the
one rule neither result is labelled better. Both causes are read from the controller's code; both corrections are
stated here, as law, before the tests run again.

**1. Only a sensed muscle moves (the fairness cause).** Let the probe measure the response time of the services in a
set $\mathcal{S}$ (`--sensed ns/deployment,...`; empty means every HPA, the single-service case). For each HPA $h$
scaling a deployment $d(h)$ with the operator's target $x^{op}_h$, the target written is

$$x_h(t) = \begin{cases} \text{the compass's (or the allocation law's) target} & d(h) \in \mathcal{S} \\ x^{op}_h & d(h) \notin \mathcal{S} \end{cases}$$

The probe's position $p$ is a statement about $\mathcal{S}$ alone. A push on a muscle outside $\mathcal{S}$ answers no
sensed error and adds pods that compete with $\mathcal{S}$ for the same machines (the run's pending pods and failures).
It is the GPU law's own rule, applied to Kubernetes: where Omni-Compass cannot sense, it stands at native's own setting.

**2. Pods owed to a growing demand stay (the churn cause).** Let $u(t)$ be the CPU the workers use and $W$ the HPA's
scale-down window ($W = 300$ s unless the operator set one). The demand is *still growing* when

$$G(t) = \Big[\, u(t) > (1 + \epsilon)\, \min_{t - W \le s \le t} u(s) \,\Big], \qquad \epsilon = 0.05 .$$

After a breach the compass lowers the target to the bottom of its cover, $x = x_{lo} = 0.6\,x^{op}$ (more pods, at once).
Before this amendment, the first decision with the position back under the centre, $p < c = 0.4$, no breach and no
pod waiting, returned $x = x^{op}$ at once. Under a rising load the autoscaler then removed the extra pods one window
later and started them again at the next step: the run's churn. The return is now

$$x \leftarrow x^{op} \quad \text{only if} \quad p < c,\ \ \text{no breach},\ \ \text{no pod waiting},\ \ \neg G(t),$$

and while $G(t)$ holds the target stays where the breach put it. A fault or a spike that has passed has a flat or
falling $u$, so $G$ is false and the operator's target returns at once, as the fault test requires (set 31 F:
HPA replicas under faults −1.1%); only a demand still climbing keeps its pods. $\epsilon = 0.05$ is set above the
decision-to-decision noise of the node CPU reading. A rise too small to clear it leaves the rule as it was before this
amendment (the target returns at once), so the correction can remove churn but cannot add any.

Nothing else changes: the compass's band, gains and centre, the verdict, the fail-up rules, the release gate and the
node-pool law are as registered. Tests: `tests/test_compass_controller.py`, cases *demand* and *sensed*, beside the
existing *fault over*, *blind* and reset cases.

**The re-runs**, on the commit that carries this amendment, unchanged in design: the capacity test (`load_steps` 1 to
8, 1,600 s), the fairness test (`two_app` 1, 900 s) and the fault test (`faults` 1, 900 s), 10 paired repetitions
each, arms native / omni / compass. The second application is now probed and reported as before, and its HPA is held at
the operator's target. Labelled by the one rule. Every number, whatever it says, is published beside the runs above.

### The re-runs under the amendment: results (2026-10-04)

All three on commit `199f350`, 10 paired repetitions each, the design unchanged.

- **Fault test, set 32 F** (`results/live/FAULTS_32.md`, run 37162459956): **no measure significantly worse under
  either law.** The compass law recovers from a lost machine 58% faster and starts 34% fewer pods; the amendment left the
  fault behaviour of set 31 F intact.
- **Fairness** (`results/live/FAIRNESS_2.md`, run 37162458834): **correction 1 holds.** With the compass law php-apache's
  failed requests are no longer worse (−14.0%, not significant; before +26.0%), pending pods −10.5% (before +65.2%);
  the neighbour unharmed under both laws. The compass law's response-time gains in this test are no longer significant.
  Still worse under both laws: the mean pod start wait (+1.1 s compass, +1.7 s allocation law).
- **Capacity** (`results/live/CAPACITY_2.md`, run 37162457542): the compass law served **24.6 against native's 16.2
  requests a second, +51.9% (+6.2 to +10.6)**, the same paired difference as the first run on slower runners;
  response times −28% to −56%, failures −9.6%, HPA replicas −10.7%. **Correction 2 did not remove the extra pod
  starts** (5.1 against 3.8, +34.2%; before +30.4%): its premise, that the extra starts were pods removed and started
  again between steps, is not borne out. With the mean replicas lower, the reading the data support is pods started
  earlier on a rising load, the mechanism of the added capacity. Correction 2 stays (it removes no gain and added no
  measure worse); the pod-start rows stand as measured, and by the one rule neither the capacity nor the fairness arm
  is labelled better while they do.

### The pod record, and the second amendment (2026-10-04, before the next runs)

**What the pod record shows** (`tools/pod_report.py`, workflow `pod-report`, read from the stored artifacts of runs
37162457542 and 37162458834; nothing re-run). In the capacity test native started its pods once, early (33 of 38 in
the first fifth of the window), and removed none. With Omni-Compass on top, two minutes into the window the controller
raised the HPA target above the operator's (the conveyance: each pod given a larger CPU limit, the target raised by the
same factor so each pod stays as busy, $x = g\,x^{op}$; 114% with the compass law, 190% with the allocation law). The
autoscaler then removed pods (14 with the compass law, 35 with the allocation law, over ten repetitions), and the next
load steps started them again. **The extra starts are exactly those removals.** Correction 2 above read the wrong
signal: the CPU used by the whole node, where one load step is lost in the node's own load.

**3. A raise of the target waits for a steady demand.** Let the demand on an HPA's service be read from the
autoscaler's own status, $D(t) = \bar{u}(t)\, r(t)$: the pods' mean CPU utilisation of their request times the pods
running, the CPU used in units of one pod's request. With $W$ the HPA's scale-down window and $\epsilon = 0.05$,

$$S(t) = \Big[\, t - t_0 \ge 0.9\,W \ \wedge\ \max_{[t-W,\,t]} D \le (1+\epsilon)\min_{[t-W,\,t]} D \,\Big]$$

($t_0$ the oldest sample in the window). A new target above the one standing (fewer, larger pods) is written only
when $S(t)$ holds; the autoscaler itself removes pods only after its scale-down window, and Omni-Compass now asks the
same of its own consolidation. A lower target (more pods) is never held, and the return of the operator's own target
after a fault (rule 2) is unchanged. Correction 2's growth test $G(t)$ now reads the same $D(t)$ of the HPA concerned,
not the node's CPU. Tests: `tests/test_compass_controller.py`, case *steady*.

The capacity, fairness and fault tests are run again on the commit that carries this amendment, unchanged in design,
and published beside the runs above whatever they show. The bill run on Azure (`aks-metered`, run 37171672509)
started on commit `199f350`, before this amendment, and is reported as of that commit.

### The third amendment, and a change considered and declined (2026-10-04, before the next runs)

**4. A lower target is never held.** Until now every new HPA target, in either direction, was held for one autoscaler
window $W$ while the line was clean, so on a step up the compass's push (a lower target, more pods) could wait up to $W$
and the pods arrive after the line is missed. The hold exists because a raise inside the window removes pods the
autoscaler then starts again; a lower target asks for pods and removes none. The hold now applies to raises only:

$$\text{write } x_h(t) \iff x_h(t) < x_h^{\text{now}}\ \vee\ \text{no write in } [t-W,\,t)\ \vee\ \text{the operator's own target returns},$$

with rule 3 still requiring a steady demand before any raise. Tests: `tests/test_convey.py` (a lower target written at
once inside the window).

**Declined: raising the replica cap above the operator's.** `deploy/kind/demo.yaml` sets `maxReplicas: 10`, and at
the top of the capacity test both arms meet it. Lifting it would let Omni-Compass run more pods than the operator
authorised, which is more resources, not the same resources used better, and it would break the shield's standing
rule that Omni-Compass never moves past an operator's bound. Native would need the same cap for the comparison to
stay fair. It stays at the operator's value in every arm; a higher cap is the operator's decision, tested as its own
setting if ever asked for. Already in place and unchanged: a pod waiting for a place reads as past the wall and asks
for one machine more at once.

A narrower form was proposed the same day (`docs/history/AMENDMENT_RISING_STEP_CAP.md`): while the demand rises and a
pod of the sensed service is pending, raise `maxReplicas` by the pending count and lower the target to match. It is
declined for a mechanical reason as well as the one above. The replica cap does not make pods pending: at the cap the
autoscaler simply asks for no more pods, so the pending count there is zero and the write would never fire where it is
aimed. A pod is pending only when the scheduler finds no machine with room for it, and more places under the cap give
such a pod nowhere more to go; the answer to that is a machine, which the compass already asks for. The part of the
proposal that holds, asking for pods at once on a step up instead of after a window, is rule 4 above.

On the CPU fill (used over allocatable about 0.10 in every arm): on kind every worker reports all of the host's cores
as its own, so the allocatable counts the same cores once per worker and the fill reads far lower than the machine
doing the work. Every receipt from the next runs on carries the host's own busy share and core count
(`host_cpu.csv`, `tools/live_reps.py`), so the room left on the real machine is measured, not inferred.

The capacity, fairness and fault tests are run again on the commit that carries this amendment, beside the runs of
commit `5d2e238` (rule 3 alone), so each rule's effect stays separable.

### The second amendment's runs: results (2026-10-04)

`results/live/AMENDMENT_2_RUNS.md`, commit `5d2e238` (rule 3 alone), 10 paired repetitions each.

- **Capacity: no measure significantly worse under either law.** Compass law 24.6 against native's 17.4 requests a
  second, +41.4% (+5.4 to +9.0); allocation law 25.2, +44.8% (+4.9 to +10.7). The compass law's pods started 5.7 against
  4.1, interval −0.64 to +3.84: no longer significant. Rule 3 removed the significant pod-start excess and lifted the
  allocation law's capacity from +0.0% to +44.8%.
- **Faults: no measure significantly worse under either law.**
- **Fairness: the compass law, no measure significantly worse for either application.** The allocation law: php-apache
  much better, and the neighbour's failed requests **+0.74 points (+0.19 to +1.28), significant**. The allocation law
  conveys idle CPU to the service it senses; on machines shared with a surging neighbour that CPU is the neighbour's
  headroom. The allocation law is not labelled better in this test.

**Standing after rule 3: the compass law is clean in all three tests** (no measure significantly worse, capacity +41.4%).
Rule 4 (a lower target never held) runs next on commit `583c97f`, beside these, to see whether it adds capacity without
costing a row.

### The fourth amendment: the replica cap as a lever the operator grants (2026-10-04, before its run)

The founder's instruction: no number in the harness is hard-wired; every one moves where the system lets it. The cap
of 10 in `deploy/kind/demo.yaml` is the value of Kubernetes' own php-apache example, not a choice of any operator, and
an earlier session read it as an operator's bound. It becomes a lever, under the operator's grant.

**5. Replica room.** With `--replica-ceiling` $N_{\max}$ granted (0, the default, leaves the cap untouched), for a
sensed HPA under the compass law, with $r$ the pods running, $c$ the cap, $\bar{u}$ the pods' mean utilisation and $x$
the target, the autoscaler's own arithmetic asks for $n = \lceil r\,\bar{u}/x \rceil$ replicas, and

$$c \leftarrow \min(N_{\max},\, n) \quad \text{if } r \ge c,\ n > c,\ p \ge \text{centre or the line is breached};$$
$$c \leftarrow c^{op} \quad \text{if } n \le c^{op},\ p < \text{centre},\ \text{no breach},\ S(t).$$

The cap is raised only while it binds and the line is threatened, to what the autoscaler asks and never past the grant,
and returns to the operator's once the demand has held still for a window. The operator's range is recorded before
the first change; the reset restores it. Tests: `tests/test_compass_controller.py`, case *room*.

**Its run** (a setting of its own, labelled as such): the capacity test unchanged, `replica_ceiling` 30, beside the
runs without it. Native keeps its cap of 10, as an operator who has not raised it would; the extra pods the compass uses
are counted in the HPA replicas row, so the receipt shows what the capacity cost in pods, not the gain alone.

### The third and fourth amendments, and the bill on a real cloud: results (2026-10-04)

**Rule 4** (`results/live/AMENDMENT_3_RUNS.md`, commit `583c97f`): **the compass law has no measure more than 2% worse in
any of the three tests.** Capacity +48.1% (+5.7 to +9.9), nothing worse; fairness, neither application worse (energy
per core-hour on the declared standby model +1.5%, inside the allowance); faults, nothing worse, lost-machine recovery
−61%. The allocation law: capacity +55.6%, nothing worse; in fairness the neighbour no longer worse. The first runs with
the real machine metered: a 4-core GitHub runner 48% to 70% busy, where kind's "used / allocatable" reads 0.07 to 0.10.

**Rule 5, the replica lever** (`results/live/REPLICA_ROOM.md`, commit `2101c3d`, ceiling 30): the compass law served 24.6
requests a second, the same as without the lever, with 78% more pods and 26 pod starts against native's 4.6, both
significant. **The replica cap was not what limited the service; the machine doing the work was.** The lever stays,
off by default, as the operator's to grant where machines have room; it is not part of Omni-Compass's default setting
and this setting is not labelled better.

**The bill on a real cloud** (`results/live/AKS_BILL.md`, run 37187059424, commit `5b2832f`, four paired repetitions):
**no difference in the bill either way** (allocation law −0.6%, compass law +0.8%, intervals across zero) and no measure
significantly worse. Azure's own autoscaler already ran the workload on about 1.86 of 4 workers, so this light
workload leaves no machine to give back. The machine savings measured on kind, where native has no node autoscaler, do
not carry to a cloud with one at this load; that is the reading of record. The preregistered size `Standard_D2s_v5` is
not allowed in the subscription's region; `Standard_D2s_v4` (same 2 vCPU, 8 GiB and list price) was used. Three
earlier attempts stopped at the load generator's placement before any measurement and are not results.


### The burst bill test (written before its run, 2026-10-04)

The steady bill run left Azure's autoscaler nothing to do and Omni-Compass no machine to give back. The question a
buyer asks is the bill under load that moves: on a real cloud, with Azure's own cluster autoscaler underneath, does
native with Omni-Compass on top bill fewer machine-hours than native alone when demand rises and falls? Same design as
"The bill on a real cloud" (fresh AKS cluster per arm, work pool 1 to 4 `Standard_D2s_v4` under Azure's autoscaler, the
bill metered every 15 s, arms native / compass / omni rotated, five repetitions), with the open-loop load in bursts
(`load_steps` 1 6 1 8 1 6, six steps over 1,800 measured seconds, the same steps in every arm). Reported: machine-hours
and the bill at list price, paired against native with their 95% intervals, beside every service gauge. Labelled by the
one rule: a lower bill counts only if nothing is more than 2% worse.


### The six organisms with the real cluster inside (written before its run, 2026-10-04)

Every benchmark runs the same six organisms, native against native with Omni-Compass on top: the four realms, the whole
tower of 656 muscles, and the four stacked with every duplicate kept (1,226). Six organisms, two arms, twelve columns.
The model grid (`six`) and the card in the loop (`tools/run_hil.py`, single card and eight cards) already do. The
Kubernetes runs now do too (`tools/run_kil.py`, workflow `six-kube` on kind, input `organism` on `aks-metered`).

Each organism runs on the measured window's clock, 240 steps, with the real cluster as one more muscle:

- efferent: the organism's offered compute work at step k, D(k) = sum over its compute pools of lam_i(k) / sum of
  lam0_i, the seeded trace, identical in both arms. The load generator runs
  r(k) = 1 + round((LOAD_MAX - 1) (D(k) - min D) / (max D - min D)) replicas, LOAD_MAX = 6 declared here, open-loop load.
- afferent: the cluster's watts (capture.csv, the declared power model, every 15 s, identical accounting in both arms)
  are added to the organism's source, zone and site power, as the card's watts are in the card harness.
- the clock (stated 2026-10-07, after the 1,000-copy runs): the organism must keep the window's clock. `tools/run_kil.py`
  records how long after the window its last step ended (`behind_s`); the report (`tools/six_kube_report.py`) shows it as
  "organism behind its window (s)", shown and not judged, and marks a repetition OFF THE CLOCK when either arm ended more
  than 5% of the window late, because its last steps then saw a cluster whose load schedule had already ended. The pairing
  stands (both arms slip alike), the mark stays on the cell. The remedy is a longer window for that size on that machine
  (240 steps, each at least the machine's time to step the organism once), never a change to the organism or the law:
  the four stacked at 1,000 copies (1.7 million muscles) step in about 31 s on an 8-vCPU machine, so their window is
  10,800 s (45 s steps), against 2,880 s for the tower at 1,000 copies.

Arms: native (the stacks' own controllers, Kubernetes alone, Omni-Compass not started) and compass (the compass law on every
simulated muscle, rule 4 on the cluster, handed back at 90% of the window; the run is invalid if any knob is not handed
back). Five paired repetitions per organism, order rotated, each arm on a fresh six-worker kind cluster, 960 measured
seconds. Seed 6000 for every organism and arm.

Reported in `SIX_KUBE.md` (`tools/six_kube_report.py`): twelve columns of means, then per organism every gauge paired
against native with its 95% interval. Cluster rows are measured; organism rows are models (evidence S). Each organism is
labelled by the one rule: no measure more than 2% worse (CPU and host load shown, not judged), and a gain counts only
where energy or the bill is lower with an interval wholly below zero.


#### Result: the six organisms with the real cluster inside (run 37217362568, commit `d81d5ee`)

Thirty jobs, six organisms times five paired repetitions, native against native with Omni-Compass on top (compass law),
every arm valid, every simulated knob handed back. Full report `results/live/SIX_KUBE.md`; raw files
`results/live/raw/run-37217362568/`.

On the real cluster, in every organism, native + Omni was late less often and answered faster:

| Organism | Time over the line, native → Omni | p95, native → Omni (ms) | Failed requests, native → Omni |
|---|---|---|---|
| Compute / AI / Cloud | 41.0% → 26.7% (better, -35%) | 3,967 → 2,653 (better, -33%, inside the noise) | 14.9% → 13.3% |
| Physics / Robotics / Autonomous | 28.4% → 15.5% (better, -45%) | 2,440 → 1,767 (better, -28%) | 5.7% → 5.0% |
| Energy / Facility / Industrial | 21.6% → 10.4% (better, -52%) | 1,951 → 1,482 (better, -24%) | 3.8% → 3.2% |
| Distribution / Specialized | 40.7% → 21.1% (better, -48%) | 2,830 → 1,943 (better, -31%) | 11.1% → 9.3% |
| The whole tower (656) | 25.8% → 14.7% (better, -43%, inside the noise) | 2,085 → 1,247 (better, -40%, inside the noise) | 12.8% → 9.1% |
| The four stacked (1,226) | 55.6% → 43.0% (better, -23%) | 3,703 → 2,803 (better, -24%) | 31.7% → 27.6% |

No measure came out worse beyond the noise in any organism. Energy (declared model) and CPU moved by under 3%, lower
with Omni in every organism. The modelled organisms around the cluster: work the same, energy 0.1-0.2% lower, time over
the line 0.5-2% lower, in every organism (evidence S).

Read with it: at a peak of six open-loop load generators the 4-core runner is past what the six workers can serve in
both arms (native late 22-56% of the time, 4-32% of requests failed; host 65-91% busy). The comparison is fair (same
load, same seed, same runner per pair); the absolute levels are an overloaded cluster, and a lower `load_max` is the
setting for a cluster inside its capacity.


### More work, faster, on fewer machines, with less energy: all four in one run (written before its run, 2026-10-04)

The four gains so far come from different tests: more work on the same machines (the capacity test, +48.1%), the same
work faster on fewer machines (sets 22-27), energy equal or lower in each. This test measures all four in one run.

Design: `benchmark-reps`, ten paired repetitions, arms native and compass (rule 4), order rotated, fresh six-worker kind
cluster per arm, open-loop load rising and then falling, `load_steps` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1, 180 s a step
(2,700 measured seconds). The rise is the capacity test (`tools/live_reps.py capacity`, read on the way up to the
peak: the highest load step at which no more than 5% of response samples are over the 500 ms line or failed, every
lower step too). The fall is where machines are no longer needed and can be handed back. Over the whole window:
p95 response time, worker machines in service, energy (declared model; on kind it is not a meter), CPU with Omni's own.

Reported for each, native + Omni against native, paired, with the 95% interval and read in words (better or worse):
work (capacity, requests a second inside the line), speed (p95), machines (worker machines in service, mean), energy.

### The Omni index: one number for more for the same, or the same for less (written before its first use, 2026-10-04)

Each measure is turned into a ratio oriented so that above 1 is better for Omni-Compass:

- work: work with Omni / work native (capacity, requests served, work done)
- speed: p95 native / p95 with Omni (a lower response time is faster)
- machines: machines native / machines with Omni (in service, or billed machine-hours)
- energy: energy native / energy with Omni (or the bill)

The index of one test is the geometric mean of its oriented ratios, minus one, in percent: +30% reads "30% more for
the same, or the same for 30% less", across work, speed, machines and energy together. A measure a test did not take is
left out of that test, never filled in. A measure inside the noise is counted at its mean and flagged. A category
(real Kubernetes on GitHub, Azure, the card, the eight cards, the modelled muscles) is the geometric mean of its tests;
the headline is the geometric mean of the real categories, each weighted the same; the modelled muscles are shown
beside it, never inside it. Computed by `tools/omni_index.py` from each test's own paired results; nothing is typed in.


### Demand that wanders: up, spike, partway down, back up, down to idle (written before its run, 2026-10-04)

Real demand does not rise once and fall once. It climbs, spikes, eases part way, climbs again and finally settles to
idle. This test drives that shape and asks whether machines follow it in order: the emptiest machine idles first on the
way down (powered and Ready at its floor, never off), the warm machines wake first on the way up (no boot), one machine
always in service for the first burst (`scripts/kind_nodepool.sh`).

Design as the all-four test (ten pairs, native and compass, open-loop load, fresh six-worker kind cluster per arm), with
`load_steps` 1 2 3 2 3 4 5 6 5 3 5 6 5 4 3 2 3 2 1 1 (twenty steps of 135 s, 2,700 measured seconds), the same steps in
every arm. Reported, native + Omni against native, paired with the 95% interval and read in words: time over the 500 ms
line, failed requests, p95, worker machines in service (and its trace step by step), energy (declared model), CPU with
Omni's own, pods started. No capacity is read (the load does not only rise).


#### Amendment to the wandering test, written before its run (2026-10-04)

The founder's two rules for real traffic, adopted before any result of the wandering test: traffic moves one step at a
time, up or down, never skipping (it may go 1 2 1 2 1 2 if it never needs 3); and machines never go below two, so two
are always in service, ready for a spike, with no ceiling but the machines the cluster has. The run started with the
earlier steps (which jumped 5 to 3 and 3 to 5) was cancelled before it finished; none of it is reported.

From this amendment: the machine floor is two in every arm Omni-Compass governs (`MIN_NODES`, default 2: the
controller's `--min-nodes`, the actuator `scripts/kind_nodepool.sh`, and every benchmark script). Native's own floor is
the cluster's: kind keeps all six workers. The wandering steps are 1 2 3 2 3 4 5 6 5 4 5 6 7 8 7 6 5 4 3 4 3 2 1 2 1
(twenty-five steps of 108 s, 2,700 measured seconds), every change one step, the same in every arm. Everything else
is as written above.


#### Result: all four in one run (run 37226863122)

Ten paired repetitions, every arm valid. **Work +29.3%** (capacity 24.6 to 31.8 requests a second inside the line,
interval +5.4 to +9.0), **p95 -62.3%** (685.8 to 258.3 ms), time over the line -40.9%, failed requests -12.1%,
**machines in service -3.6%**, **energy -0.3%** (declared model), CPU with Omni's own -1.9%: each proven. No measure
worse beyond the noise (pending pod-minutes +19.6% and pods started +4.0%, both inside the noise). This run's machine
floor was one; the floor of two was adopted after it started. Report `results/live/ALL_FOUR.md`; raw files
`results/live/raw/run-37226863122/`; the Omni index updated (`results/OMNI_INDEX.md`).


#### The boundary is the band, not a machine held out (written 2026-10-04, for every run started after it)

Holding one whole machine back as a ceiling was considered and set aside the same day: it takes one of the machines
away from the work. Every machine is usable (Omni-Compass's most is every machine that exists); the floor of two stays
for quiet times. The protection against running into the wall is the band inside every machine: capacity is added at
95% of the response line, before the line is reached, and a machine goes back only if the ones left still run at or
under the engine's utilisation target. An operator who wants whole machines held back can set `NODE_CUSHION` (off by
default). The wandering run under way (37235231963) uses every machine, as every run after it does.


### The six organisms at every size, the real cluster inside (written before its run, 2026-10-04)

The same six organisms, each native against native with Omni-Compass on top, at the sizes of the model grid: 10, 100
and 1,000 copies of the organism governed together on one clock, the one real cluster inside as one more muscle
(`tools/run_kil.py --scale`; size 1 is the run already recorded, `results/live/SIX_KUBE.md`). Workflow `six-kube`, one
job per organism, size and repetition, both arms on one runner, order rotated, fresh six-worker kind cluster per arm.

- Repetitions: 5 at 10 and 100 copies, 3 at 1,000. Measured window: 960 s at 10 copies, 1,440 s at 100, 2,880 s at
  1,000 (240 organism steps of 4, 6 and 12 s: a step at least 1.5 times what the organism takes to compute on this
  runner, measured: 0.18 s at 10 copies of the four stacked, 2.4 s at 100).
- The organism is built before the window opens (`organism.ready`); the window opens the moment it is built
  (`organism.go`), so the cluster and the organism start on one clock however long the build takes. If the organism
  falls behind its own clock, `organism.json` records by how much (`behind_s`).
- Machine floor two, every machine usable (the founder's rules above), open-loop load, peak six generators.
- Declared before the run: 1,000 copies of the whole tower (656,000 modelled muscles) and of the four stacked (1.2
  million) need about 6 and 11 GB of memory beside the cluster, past what one GitHub runner holds. They are run; if a
  runner cannot hold them, the job's failure is reported as that, never as a result.

Reported in `SIX_KUBE.md` by organism and size, every gauge paired against native with its 95% interval and read in
words.

The run dimension of the model grid (1, 10, 100, 1,000 runs) is a count of seeds; on the real cluster each repetition
is a real paired run of an hour or more, so the real cluster carries the repetitions above, and the model grid carries
1 to 1,000 runs.


#### The two organisms too big for a GitHub runner: a larger rented machine (written before their run, 2026-10-05)

1,000 copies of the whole tower and of the four stacked run on a larger rented machine, the same test otherwise:
workflow `big-organism` rents one Azure Standard_D8s_v4 (8 vCPU, 32 GiB) per repetition, runs `scripts/kind_paired.sh`
on it (native against native with Omni-Compass on top, fresh six-worker kind cluster per arm, 2,880 measured seconds,
the organism at 1,000 copies with the real cluster inside), copies every file back and deletes the machine whatever
happens. Three paired repetitions per organism, two machines at a time. Its results join `SIX_KUBE.md` at 1,000 copies;
the same cells from GitHub runners count only if the runner held them.


#### The burst bill test on Azure: two native arms lost to the harness, and the fix (2026-10-05)

Repetitions 2 and 3 of the burst bill test (run 37216328055) each lost their native arm (Kubernetes alone) at the
same moment: the load step from one generator to six. Native's two work machines were full, answers timed out, and the
API server stopped answering for minutes. The capture script ran with stop-on-first-error, so one unanswered reading
ended the recording, and the load schedule stopped at its next unanswered scale; the arm failed its checks and was
marked invalid. The Omni-Compass arms of the same repetitions ran every step. Those two arms are not counted.

That is a fault of the harness, and it threw away exactly the moments a cluster struggles. Fixed: a reading the API
server does not answer is logged (`capture.csv.errors`) and skipped, and the recording goes on; a scale the API server
does not answer is tried again, then logged, and the schedule goes on (`fleet/capture/kube_capture.sh`,
`scripts/kind_bench.sh`, `tools/run_kil.py`). Repetitions 4 and 5 started on the earlier code. When the run ends, three
more repetitions of the same test run on the fixed code, and the report counts every valid pair and names every
invalid arm with its cause.


### Amendment 6: a pinned gauge is not a steady demand (written before its run, 2026-10-05)

The wandering test (run 37235231963, ten pairs) gave native + Omni-Compass p95 -54%, time over the line -38%, failed
requests -14%, energy -0.3% and CPU -2%, each proven, and 1.5 more pod starts a run (+36%, proven). The founder holds
that result back until the cause is fixed and the test is run again.

The cause, read from the run's own audit (repetition 4, 12 pod starts against native's 7): at 972 s the load eased
from five generators to four, rule 3 found the demand steady, and the target was raised (50 to 190: fewer pods); the
load then climbed back to eight and the pods were started again. The demand was not steady. The autoscaler stood at its
replica cap, every pod as busy as it could be, so the reading (utilisation times pods) could not rise however much the
load did: a pinned gauge reads flat.

Rule 5 (amends rule 3): a decision at which the autoscaler stands at its replica cap marks the window pinned; a window
that touched the cap is not steady, so no raise of the target, and no return of a raised cap, until one whole
autoscaler window after the cap was last touched (`omni_controller/controller.py _steady`, `self.pinned`; tested in
`tests/test_compass_controller.py`). Nothing else changes.

The rerun: the same wandering test (ten pairs, native and compass, `load_steps` 1 2 3 2 3 4 5 6 5 4 5 6 7 8 7 6 5 4 3 4 3
2 1 2 1, 2,700 s, floor two, every machine usable). Reported in full, every gauge read in words; the first run is kept
in its raw files and named beside the rerun.


### Amendment 7: coasting, off the gas but still in gear (written before its run, 2026-10-05)

The founder's picture: a car in drive. At idle it creeps, ready (the floor of two machines). On the gas it speeds up at
once (more pods, machines woken, no boot). Off the gas it coasts down gradually toward idle; it does not drop into
neutral. The brake is for stopping (the reset hands everything back at once).

Rule 6: a raise of the HPA target (toward fewer pods) moves by at most `--coast-step` points of utilisation in one
autoscaler window (default 25, `COAST_STEP`; 0 turns it off). The first wandering run raised the target 50 to 190 in
one move; under rule 6 the same raise takes several calm windows (50, 75, 100, ...). A demand that comes back part way
finds the pods still running and is met at once by a lower target, with no pod started again. A lower target (more
pods) is never limited: the gas is always immediate. Rules 5 and 6 together: never ease off while the gauge is pinned,
and then ease off a step at a time (`omni_controller/controller.py`; tested in `tests/test_convey.py`).

The rerun with rule 5 alone (run 37255770249) was stopped before it finished, to run the test once with both rules;
none of it is reported. The rerun: the wandering test as written in amendment 6.


### Amendment 8: cruise and the emergency brake, and the batch test (written before its run, 2026-10-05)

The founder's driving modes: off (native alone), watching (Omni-Compass reads, writes nothing), autopilot (gas, brake,
idle), and two more for work that comes as a pile:

- **Rule 7, cruise:** work waiting for a place (pods pending) two decisions in a row puts every machine in service
  (`--max-nodes`), and they stay in service, without second-guessing, until the line has been empty and nothing is
  scaling up for two decisions (`--cruise-after`, default 2; 0 turns it off).
- **Rule 8, the emergency brake:** nothing waiting, no response-time breach, nothing scaling up, and the sensed
  services' demand at or under 0.05 of one pod's request (`--brake-demand`): the machines go straight to the floor
  (two) in one move. Every check of the release gate still holds (every sense live, the last command landed, the
  machines left at or under the utilisation target) except one machine per decision. Never below the floor.
- Tested through the live controller: `tests/test_cruise_brake.py` (in `verify.py`).

**The batch test:** a queue of jobs on the six-worker kind cluster (`WORKLOAD=batch`, `deploy/kind/batch-jobs.yaml`):
one Kubernetes Job of 240 pods, 60 at a time (more than the workers hold, so work waits for a place), each hashing
3,000 MB (real CPU work, identical in every arm), opened with the measured window (1,500 s); the service's load
generator stands at zero. Ten pairs, native and compass, order rotated. Reported, paired with the 95% interval and read in
words: how long the queue took to finish, the worker machines in service after it finished, machines in service and
energy over the whole window, CPU with Omni-Compass's own, pods started. Cruise must not slow the queue; the brake must
show in the machines held after it.

### The frozen engine (rules 1-8, commit 353903683009): the fault and fairness results (2026-10-05)

Both tests ran again with nothing changed but the engine: ten pairs each, native and omni, order rotated.

- The fault test (GitHub run 37262797634, `results/live/FAULTS.md`): better and proven on p95 (−60.1%), mean response
  (−34.5%), time over the line (−22.6%) and pending pods (−76.5%). Nothing came out worse beyond the noise. Recovery
  after the fault, paired means: machine down 42 s against 70 s, a blind probe 54 s against 66 s, a runaway pod 98 s
  against 105 s, a spike 266 s against 267 s.
- The fairness test (GitHub run 37262799317, `results/live/FAIRNESS.md`): better and proven on mean response (−15.0%).
  Nothing came out worse beyond the noise, the neighbour's app included.

These replace the earlier engine's fault and fairness sections of `results/live/AMENDMENT_3_RUNS.md` in the Omni index.
That file stays as first measured.

The Azure burst bill test and the big organisms, running them (2026-10-05): Azure no longer offers this subscription
Standard_D2s_v5 in eastus, so AKS workers are Standard_D2s_v4 (2 vCPU, 8 GiB, the same list price, USD 0.096 an
hour). Both arms use the same size; the steady-load result of record (`results/live/AKS_BILL.md`) stays as measured on
D2s_v5. The big-organism machine failed while seven kind nodes joined (kubelet-start). Fresh Ubuntu ships too few
inotify watchers for that; the rented machine now raises them as kind's own documentation advises. Neither change
touches the controller.

### Amendment 9: idle read from the autoscaler's floor, and the batch test again (written before its run, 2026-10-05)

The batch test on the frozen engine (GitHub run 37262795697) showed rule 8 late. The queue emptied 664 s into the
window, but the emergency brake fired at 1,574 s. The reason: a served service is never at zero CPU. The response
probe alone keeps one pod at about 10% of its request, which reads as demand 0.10, above the brake's 0.05. Rule 8 now
also counts a service as idle when its autoscaler stands at its least pods (`minReplicas`), wants no more, and runs at
no more than half its target utilisation. Every other condition of rule 8 holds as before: nothing waiting, no breach,
nothing scaling up, the release gate, every sense live, the last command landed, and the machines left carrying what
runs now under the utilisation target. Test: `tests/test_cruise_brake.py` (it brakes at the idle floor, and it does not
brake above the floor or busy at it).

Effect on what was already measured: none. The steady, fault, fairness, wandering and all-four runs on the frozen engine
had the service at one pod with nothing waiting in 0 of 5,102 readings, so the amended rule could not have fired in any
of them.

Three of the ten batch pairs stopped, all in the omni arm. The API server answered 500 under the batch load (60 jobs
asking for 30 cores on a 4-core runner), and the recording script ended on an unanswered `kubectl top nodes`. That is a
harness fault: a reading the API server does not answer is now logged and skipped, and the end-of-window reads are tried
again. The batch test runs again, ten pairs, on this engine, with the design unchanged.

### Amendment 10: two rows read for what they measure (written after the frozen-engine runs were seen, 2026-10-05)

Disclosed: this is a change in how two rows are read, made after the steady, wandering and all-four results were seen.
Both rows stay in every table with their numbers and intervals; only the word in the last column changes.

- **Pending pods.** The row counts pods pending in each 15 s snapshot. A pod the autoscaler has just created is pending
  for the seconds it takes to schedule and start, so a faster scale-up shows as more pending pods. In the steady run
  the extra pending pods came at the load steps (about 180 s and 600 s), with every machine in service, and the API
  server's own record shows no pod in either arm ever unschedulable. The row is now shown, not judged. The judged gauge
  is the scheduler's own verdict, from the pod record: pods that no machine would take (PodScheduled False, reason
  Unschedulable), counted and timed in pod-minutes. In the five frozen-engine runs it is 0 in every arm.
- **Energy per core-hour.** It is energy divided by CPU used. CPU used is shown, not judged (more or less is not better
  by itself), so a ratio over it is not judged either. Energy itself stays judged.

Nothing else changes. With these readings, no row of the steady, wandering, all-four, fault or fairness results is
worse than native beyond the noise.

### Amendment 11: the burst bill test sized to what the service can serve, and rounding read as the same (2026-10-05)

Disclosed: written after three repetitions of the burst test at `1 6 1 8 1 6` were seen. In them about 41% of requests
failed in both arms. The service's own autoscaler sat pinned at its cap of 10 pods, and 6 and 8 load generators (36
and 48 requests a second) ask more than 10 pods can serve, whatever the machines. A test where neither arm can do the
work cannot show a difference. The burst test runs at `1 3 1 4 1 3`: the peak is one step above the steady test's peak
of 3, and inside what the capped service can serve. Everything else is as preregistered: five repetitions,
1,800 measured seconds, Azure's autoscaler underneath, the bill metered every 15 s, native against compass. The three
repetitions at the old steps stay in the archive (`results/live/raw/run-37294579764/`) and are reported as the reason
for this amendment, not as a result.

In every table a paired change under one part in a million of the value reads "same", the number still shown
(`SAME_REL`, `docs/MECHANISM_OF_ACTION.md` 9.5).

### Amendment 12: cruise steps back, and the organism's start file (written before the batch rerun, 2026-10-05)

The batch rerun on amendment 9 (GitHub run 37275371557, ten valid pairs) gave machines -16.9%, -27.2% once the queue
was done, and energy -11.6% on the standby model. The queue finished 10 s later (584 s against 594 s, +1.8%). Omni held
every machine in service throughout, so the time went elsewhere: every five seconds the floor step read every pod (240
batch pods), every node, node metrics and every HPA, on the one 4-core runner the queue was using. In cruise every
machine is already in service, so those reads can change no action. From this amendment, while cruising the floor step
makes no read and no write, and the service's target stays at the operator's own (`docs/MECHANISM_OF_ACTION.md` 9.3;
`tests/test_compass_controller.py`). Cruise never engaged in the steady, wandering, all-four, fault or fairness runs,
so this changes nothing there. The batch test runs again, ten pairs, design unchanged.

The organism with the real cluster inside waits for a start file. One repetition of six-kube (the four stacked, 1 copy,
repetition 2) read that file in the instant it existed but was still empty, and stopped. The file is now written whole
or not at all, and read only once it holds a number. That repetition is reported as stopped, never counted.

Also found and fixed on 2026-10-05, from the compass rename: each modelled muscle's compass was made fresh at every
decision (`docs/MECHANISM_OF_ACTION.md` 9.1). That touched the modelled organism rows of the runs started after the rename
(six-kube 37280090832, big organism 37287311224); their cluster rows are unaffected. The organism runs go again on the
fixed code.

The batch test on amendment 12 (GitHub run 37344765837, ten pairs, `results/live/BATCH.md`): machines in service -20.7%,
-32.4% once the queue was done, energy -14.3% on the standby model, mean response -11.7%, all proven. The queue finished
+1.1% later, inside the noise (it was +1.8% and proven before cruise stepped back). No pod was left without a machine.
Nothing came out worse beyond the noise.

### The fleet that can show one machine: Azure at 11 and 15 workers (written before its run, 2026-10-07)

The Azure runs so far used a work pool of 1 to 4 machines. One machine is a quarter to a half of that fleet, and the
app's replica ceiling (10 pods of 200m, about one worker's worth) kept Azure's autoscaler at about 1.9 workers in both
arms, so nothing under a quarter of the fleet could show. The steady run on v1 (5 pairs) read even on every gauge. That
is a statement about the lever, not about the law. This run makes the lever big enough to see one machine.

- **Fleet.** The subscription allows 200 vCPUs in eastus but 10 vCPUs in each machine family (every family's request to
  raise it was refused through the API on 2026-10-07: the subscription's terms), so one family gives at most 5 machines.
  The fleet is therefore several work pools, one 2-vCPU machine family each, each capped at what its family allows:
  `worker_pools` = `Standard_D2s_v4:4,Standard_D2as_v4:5,Standard_D2_v4:5,Standard_D2a_v4:5,Standard_D2ds_v4:5,Standard_D2s_v3:5,Standard_E2s_v4:5,Standard_E2as_v4:5`,
  39 workers (the DSv4 family also carries the system machine, hence 4). Every pool carries the label `omni-role=work`,
  the worker selector in both arms; the first pool keeps one machine, the others may scale to zero; every pool starts
  full and Azure's own autoscaler trims, as before. One machine is then 2.6% of the fleet. Mixed machine families are how
  real cloud fleets run; the bill is each pool's machine-hours at its own list price (`pool_prices`), Azure's own count
  every 15 s. The same autoscaler profile, a fresh cluster per arm. (Written first for 11 then 15 workers of one family;
  the family allowance made that impossible and this replaces it before any such run.)
- **Ceiling.** `hpa_max` = 9 × workers = 351 at 39 workers: nine 200m pods fit one 2-vCPU worker, so the fleet can
  fill. The same ceiling in every arm; the restore checks expect it back untouched.
- **Load.** The load generator's replica steps scale with the fleet, the same in every arm (one load replica drove
  about five pods at 50% on the 4-worker runs). Steady: `18 35 53 18 35 18` over 900 s at 39 workers (the peak asks
  for about 265 pods, thirty workers' worth). Burst: `11 35 11 53 11 35` over 1,800 s (the 4-worker burst was
  `1 3 1 4 1 3`). A fleet of another size scales the steps by workers/39, rounded.
- **Everything else as preregistered**: native (Azure's autoscaler alone) against omni (Omni-Compass on top of it,
  rule 4 on the node pool, the HPA target inside its range, handed back at 90% of the window), 5 paired repetitions,
  order rotated, the bill Azure's own machine count every 15 s at list price, the reading by `tools/live_reps.py`'s
  paired interval, every gauge reported. Engine: Omni v3 first (the newest), v1 after if the credits allow.
- **What it can say.** Better, clear of the noise, in bill or response time: Omni has value on the managed service when
  the fleet is big enough to see a machine. Even again: Omni's value there is nil at this size too, and that is the
  reading. Worse: our own wiring is suspected first, found, fixed, and the run is made again.
- **Cost.** About $8 for the steady set and $15 for the burst set at 15 workers, at list price.
- **Amendment (2026-10-07 07:18 UTC, before the counted run).** The first dispatch at 39 workers was refused by Azure on
  every repetition: the DASv4 family had 2 vCPUs left, not 10, because the rented machine running the four stacked at
  1,000 copies (`big-organism-detached`, a Standard_D8as_v4) holds 8 of that family's 10 in the same subscription. The
  run was cancelled (no arm ran) and dispatched again at **35 workers**: `Standard_D2as_v4:1`, the other seven pools as
  above; `hpa_max` 315; the steps scaled by 35/39 as this section says, steady `16 31 48 16 31 16`, burst
  `10 31 10 48 10 31`. One machine is 2.9% of this fleet. Nothing else changes. The 39-worker fleet stands for the runs
  made after the detached machine is deleted.
- **Amendment 2 (2026-10-07 09:40 UTC, before the counted run).** The 35-worker dispatch was refused too, on three
  repetitions: the DAv4 family (`Standard_D2a_v4`) has **no allowance at all** in this subscription ("remaining 0" is
  a limit of 0, not a holder), and the survey (`big-organism-detached`, mode survey, now listing every family's
  allowance and Azure's list prices) shows the same for the ESv4 and EAv4 families (`Standard_E2s_v4`,
  `Standard_E2as_v4`). Three of the eight pools could never be built. The fleet is rebuilt from families the survey
  shows allowed (10 vCPUs each) and offered in eastus: `Standard_D2s_v4:4, Standard_D2as_v4:1, Standard_D2_v4:5,
  Standard_D2ds_v4:5, Standard_D2d_v4:5, Standard_D2s_v3:5, Standard_D2as_v7:5, Standard_D2ads_v7:5, Standard_D2als_v7:5,
  Standard_D2alds_v7:5`: **45 workers** of ten families (one machine 2.2% of the fleet); `hpa_max` 405; the steps
  scaled by 45/39, steady `21 40 61 21 40 21`, burst `13 40 13 61 13 40`. List prices from Azure's own price API
  (Linux, pay as you go, eastus, USD a machine-hour): D2s_v4 0.096, D2as_v4 0.096, D2_v4 0.096, D2ds_v4 0.113, D2d_v4
  0.113, D2s_v3 0.096, D2as_v7 0.0908, D2ads_v7 0.114, D2als_v7 0.0804, D2alds_v7 0.0952 (the 0.086 used for D2as_v4
  in the refused dispatches was wrong; no bill was ever made with it). `scripts/aks_paired.sh` now checks every pool's
  size and family allowance before anything is built, so a refusal costs a minute, not a repetition. Nothing else
  changes.
- **Amendment 3 (2026-10-07 16:21 UTC, before the counted run).** The pre-flight of the 45-worker dispatch (run
  37602951929) found `Standard_D2s_v3` not offered to this subscription in eastus and stopped every repetition in a
  minute, nothing built, nothing billed; the nine other pools passed. That pool is dropped: **40 workers** of nine
  families (one machine 2.5% of the fleet), `hpa_max` 360, the steps scaled by 40/39, steady `18 36 54 18 36 18`,
  burst `11 36 11 54 11 36`, the pools' prices as in amendment 2. Nothing else changes.
- **Amendment 4 (2026-10-07 20:25 UTC, before the counted run).** Two dispatches of the 40-worker fleet (runs 37651333302
  and 37676237815) were refused by Azure itself on every repetition for four hours: "creating a new cluster is unavailable
  at this time in region eastus" (`AKSCapacityHeavyUsage`, Azure's own capacity for new clusters, not the subscription's
  allowance; the pre-flight passed each time, no arm ran, nothing was billed). Microsoft's remedy is another region, other
  cluster settings, or a retry; this subscription has more than 10 cores only in eastus. The clusters are therefore made on
  the **standard control-plane tier** (`tier` input, `AKS_TIER`) instead of the free tier, about $0.10 an hour a cluster,
  which is not in the bill (the bill counts worker machines only, in both arms alike) and changes nothing the workers or the
  autoscaler do. If the standard tier is refused too, the run waits for Azure. Nothing else changes.

## 47. The Evidence Ledger



Every material statement in the technical package gets exactly one primary evidence class. A statement never
borrows a stronger class from the one printed beside it.

| Class | Meaning | Layer |
|---|---|---|
| **T** | formally proved theorem, under stated assumptions | L1 mathematical mechanism |
| **V** | finite computational verification: exact over a declared finite set, never a theorem beyond it | L1 |
| **S** | simulation / model result | L2 modelled systems |
| **L** | live observation of external software (a real Kubernetes API, a real process) | L3 external software |
| **P** | independent physical measurement (a meter Omni does not read or control) | L4 physical plant |
| **O** | open: not established | — |

No layer stands in for another: a theorem is not a physical validation, a Monte Carlo result is not a theorem, and a
model's energy is not a meter's.

Mechanism identity for every row: `results/MECHANISM_IDENTITY.json`. Canonical engine `symmetric_verified`, mechanism
id `29d9808dfb8f…`; the printed configuration `printed_eight_line`, id `cd333dc166fb…`, is a named alternative
(Option A of the directive: one canonical, one alternative embodiment; no equivalence is claimed).

### Layer 1: the mechanism

| Class | Statement | Where |
|---|---|---|
| T | Unsaturated, the U-channel error obeys de/dt = −KP e; V = e²/2 has dV/dt = −KP e² < 0 for e ≠ 0 (inside Omega_unsat only). | `docs/TRACKING_THEOREM.md` Thm 1 |
| T | With the U drift bounded by F_bar < u_max, V decreases wherever e ≠ 0, saturated or not; e never changes sign; saturated stretches end in bounded time (continuous time). | Thm 2 |
| T | On the declared parameter box, F_bar = 16.86 < 25, so Thm 2 holds over the whole box in continuous time. | Thm 2 |
| T | The sampled controller (u held through each RK4 step) satisfies e_(k+1) = 0.88 e_k + d_k, hence abs(e_k) <= 0.88^k abs(e_0) + epsilon_h (1 − 0.88^k)/0.12. | Thm 3 |
| V | epsilon_h = 0.00378 over every micro step of the 500 frozen fixtures (nearest target); ultimate bound 0.0315 < BASIN_TOL 0.10. Wrong target: 0.0243, bound 0.20 (wider than the basin). | `results/TRACKING_BOUNDS.json` |
| V | The discrete execution dithers inside that band: abs(e) grew on 27 061 of 100 000 micro steps; e changed sign 747 times. The continuous monotone decay is not inherited. | same |
| V | Saturated micro steps: 0 of 100 000 (nearest target), 5 of 100 000 (wrong target). | same |
| T | The admissible box A (E interval, abs(U − sigma) <= abs(U0 − sigma), S between S0 and S_plus) is forward invariant in continuous time. | Thm 4 |
| V | Discrete invariance of A: 0 failures over 100 000 micro steps of the frozen fixtures, both targets. | `results/TRACKING_BOUNDS.json` |
| O | Discrete invariance and epsilon_h proved over the whole box (interval arithmetic). | — |
| O | Global stability of the forced six-state system. | `docs/FORMAL_STATUS.md` |
| V | 500 / 500 frozen fixtures satisfy CONVEY-5 and CERT-10 (dwell predicates, not external certification). | `results/core_evidence.json` |
| V | Frozen 500-fixture comparison: symmetric_verified final error 7.48e-5, integrated abs(u) 0.878, peak 13.93; printed_eight_line 5.13e-6, 11.79, 18.87. Both executable; not interchangeable. | `results/MECHANISM_IDENTITY.json` |
| V | Python and C++ produce identical results (engine, governor, shield, HPA law, conveyance, GPU rules); twins sealed. | `verify.py`, `results/SEAL.json` |

### Layer 2: models and simulations

| Class | Statement | Where |
|---|---|---|
| S | Synthetic stack: energy for Omni over the Kubernetes reference 168.9 → 121.7 kWh per run (documented-behaviour reference, not upstream controllers). | `docs/CLAIMS_REGISTER.md` C8 |
| S | Fleet harness, recorded PlanetLab shapes: −40.6% energy vs HPA+CA, −21.7% vs Karpenter-lite (omni_fleet). | C17 |
| S | Single GPU physics model: the engine alone would save 10.6–13.6% work per kJ on card A but breaks the p95 guardrail by 15–28%; with the frozen guards, about +1 to +5% inside it. | `results/gpu/sim/FINDINGS.md` |
| S | Node exchange (CPU and GPU on one budget): +1.4 to +5.7% work against the separate budgets, never over budget. | `results/hardware/NODE_EXCHANGE_*.json` |
| S | Six organisms (345, 262, 282, 337, the four stacked 1,226, the whole tower 656), the compass law on every muscle against each organism's own controllers, 1,000 paired runs at 1× and 10× size: work per energy +0.20% to +0.30%, energy −0.21% to −0.32%; every knob handed back. | `results/scale/GRID.md` |
| S | GPU card model, the card's firmware alone against the firmware with Omni on top (amendment 8: the verdict, 2% allowance), geometric means over 10 seeds and 10 fresh seeds: AI token generation, energy −3.25% / −3.72%, median +0.55% / +0.70%, p95 +0.29% / +0.26%; compute-bound, energy −0.70% / −0.48%, median +1.56% / +1.47%. A fixed 105 W power cap alone against the cap with Omni on top: energy −2.09% / −2.37% (AI token generation). | `results/sim/gpu_two_wire/RESULT.md` |
| S | Realm harness round 3 (every realm carries the shared spine), preregistered, seeds 3000-3009: the whole 656-muscle tower native against one governor on top, work per energy +0.1% (+0.1 to +0.1), violations +0.5 pp, SUPERIOR WITHIN GUARDRAILS. Realms: Energy +0.2% with +1.9 pp violations (tradeoff); Compute 0.0% with +2.1 pp (not established); Distribution −0.1% (worse); Physics −0.7% (worse). Rounds 1 and 2 kept, superseded. | `results/realms/REALMS.md` |
| S | Stacked organism (round 4, seeds 4000-4009): the four realm organisms on one clock, 1,226 muscles with every duplicate; stacked native equals the four realms alone on every seed. One governor over the stack: energy −0.14%, work per energy +0.02%, violations +1.4 pp, ENERGY IMPROVEMENT WITH SERVICE TRADEOFF; four separate governors about the same (+0.04%); one governor against four separate: −0.02% (WORSE, by a hair). | `results/realms/stack/STACK.md` |

### Layer 3: live external software

| Class | Statement | Where |
|---|---|---|
| P | First real-GPU confirmation, NVIDIA A10 (Lambda), 10 paired repetitions, the card's own meter: work per energy +3.6% (+2.7 to +4.5, proven), GPU energy −3.5%, same requests, none lost; wire check 7 of 7, every write read back, every arm restored. | `results/gpu/run-20261002T082232Z/GPU_REPS.md` |
| L | Set 25 (commit `6fa7a97`), real Kubernetes, 10 paired repetitions: machines in service −32.3%, p95 −57.3%, 0 failed requests, total CPU including Omni's own −0.6% (not proven). | `results/live/LIVE_REPS_25.md` |
| L | Set 26 (commit `e7f920d`), real Kubernetes, 10 paired repetitions, three arms: the allocation law machines −35.8%, p95 −55.4%; **the compass law in the live controller machines −17.2%, p95 −64.8%**, 0 failed requests, label by the preregistered rule *better on machines within the band*. | `results/live/LIVE_REPS_26.md` |
| L | Set 27 (commit `d46c959`), real Kubernetes, 10 paired repetitions, three arms: the allocation law machines −36.6%, p95 −53.1%; **the compass law aligned with the GPU governor machines −15.9%, p95 −65.5%, p99 −72.6%**, 0 failed requests, label by the preregistered rule *better on machines within the band*. | `results/live/LIVE_REPS_27.md` |
| L | Set 24 (2026-10-02, commit `c908054`), real Kubernetes (kind), 10 paired repetitions: machines in service −31.6% (proven), p95 response time −60.1% (proven), p99 −64.1% (proven), HPA replicas −38.6% (proven), 0 failed requests on both; total CPU including Omni's own −1.8% (not proven); energy with every machine powered −0.3% (declared model). | `results/live/LIVE_REPS_24.md` |
| L | Set 23 (set 22 repeated on the current code, 2026-10-02), real Kubernetes (kind), 10 paired repetitions, equal work: p95 response time −62% (proven), replicas −37% (proven), pods started −64% (proven), 0 failed requests; total CPU with Omni's own −1.0% and modelled energy −0.2% (no difference). | `results/live/LIVE_REPS_23.md` |
| L | Set 22, real Kubernetes (kind), 10 paired repetitions, equal work (fixed-rate load): p95 response time −61% (proven), replicas −23% (proven), pending pod-minutes −91% (proven), 0 failed requests. | `results/live/LIVE_REPS_22.md` |
| L | Set 21, real Kubernetes (kind), 10 paired repetitions: p95 response time −37% (proven), replicas −12% (proven), 0 failed requests. | `results/live/LIVE_REPS_21.md` |
| L | Omni patched a real Kubernetes API in place (no restart); the reset restored every setting in every run; watch mode wrote nothing. | same, `results/live/` |
| S | Set 21 energy is a declared model, not a meter: +1.8% worse with parked machines at idle power. | same (energy table) |

### Layer 4: independent physical measurement

| Class | Statement | Where |
|---|---|---|
| O | Omni changes successful work per measured joule on a GPU. The bench is built with three receipts (governor, actuator, outcome), the three contrasts (observation, authority, total), and result labels by rule; it has **not** been run on a card. | `scripts/gpu_paired.sh`, `docs/GPU_PREREGISTRATION.md` |
| O | Production data-centre energy effect. | — |
| O | Whether the power limit is the right actuator for LLM serving. Published measurements (arXiv 2605.11999, H200) find memory-bound decode draws 137–300 W of 700 W, so no power cap binds; clock scaling is what saves energy there (arXiv 2501.08219, GreenLLM 2508.16449). The pinned bench workload is compute-bound, where the cap does bind: a result on it does not transfer to LLM decode. | external literature |
| O | Wall-plug (whole-machine) energy effect; CPU package and DRAM (RAPL) effect. | — |
| — | What the GPU bench will attribute: per write, joules and requests against native, and which rule decided it (engine, floor, gate, reflex, heat, speed lock). | `tools/gpu_reps.py` |

### Negative evidence, kept

Nothing here is deleted when a later result looks better.

| Class | Statement | Where |
|---|---|---|
| P | Same run: p95 response time **+58.5% worse** (510 to 809 ms), mean +48%; label by rule ENERGY IMPROVEMENT WITH SERVICE TRADEOFF. Cause: governor wiring (busy bursts served below the card's own clock); corrected in amendments 6-7, not yet re-run on a card. | `results/gpu/run-20261002T082232Z/GPU_REPS.md`, `docs/GPU_PREREGISTRATION.md` |
| S | Two-wire GPU card, the profiles of amendment 7 (removed in amendment 8): service +5.3% work per energy with the median +14.8% slower; batch p95 +7.0% (−4.8 to +20.3). The governor before amendment 6 gave p95 +32.9% and +37.1%. | `docs/GPU_PREREGISTRATION.md`, history in git |
| S | Six organisms, same runs: time over the service line **+0.19 to +0.27 pp worse in every cell**; band first is not held anywhere. | `results/scale/GRID.md` |
| S | Round 6 law (HPA target held at the operator's own, machine release margin 0.6), 20 paired seeds per organism, before the grid rerun: work per energy +0.086% to +0.201%, time over the line −0.010 to −0.031 pp (better than native in all six), work unchanged within its interval, every knob handed back. | `docs/REALMS_PREREGISTRATION.md` (round 6) |
| L | Set 21: modelled energy 1.8% **worse** with every machine powered (the only honest energy row on kind). | `results/live/LIVE_REPS_21.md` |
| S | Realm harness round 1 (superseded, kept): all five organisms **worse** (whole tower −0.1%). Its Omni layer did not follow the shipped controller (no contraction authority or SLO reflex, the stack law in place of the HPA, request traffic paused, a site budget under native draw). | `results/realms/round1/` |
| S | Realm harness round 2: the Physics / Robotics / Autonomous organism **worse** (−1.9%, violations +2.9 pp); the Compute organism's +2.5% costs +2.9 pp of service violations; 68 single muscles worse, mostly batch pacing and cooling setpoints under the live cooling law. | `results/realms/REALMS.md` |
| L | Set 22, equal work: no CPU saving once Omni's own CPU is counted (service −7.6%, controller +0.070 cores, together −0.9%, not proven); modelled energy unchanged (−0.1%). | `results/live/LIVE_REPS_22.md` |
| L | Set 20: the "same work" reading was wrong; requests were +35%. | `results/live/LIVE_REPS_20.md` addendum |
| L | Sets 1–2: machine savings **withdrawn** — a broken probe had blinded the latency sense. | `results/live/LIVE_REPS_PROBE_DEFECT.md` |
| L | Set 3 with a working probe: Omni kept all 6 machines; no significant difference except more waiting pods. | `docs/HISTORY.md` |
| L | Set 21: pending pod-minutes +238% (not proven); pod starts +37% (not proven). | `results/live/LIVE_REPS_21.md` |
| S | GPU and batch: energy 1–2% **worse**, power and heat margins 1–4% worse than tight packers (AKS/Karpenter, CAST AI, Spot). | `docs/HISTORY.md` |
| S | Machine round trips 1.1 → 1.7 per run (**worse**) in 6 of 8 seed-target combinations. | C12 |
| S | Power-protect mode: backlog violations 2.5% → 6.7% (**worse**). | C12p |
| S | Park strategy on PlanetLab shapes: energy +1.3% vs HPA+CA, +33.6% vs Karpenter-lite (**worse**). | C17 |
| S | Typical response time about 20% slower than every platform in the web and four-cluster simulations. | `docs/HISTORY.md` |
| S | GPU model: the engine without its guards breaks the p95 guardrail. | `results/gpu/sim/FINDINGS.md` |
| S | The compass-stroke GPU variant was tried and not adopted. | same |
| S | Right-sizing against VPA: p95 +15%, memory (OOM) kills +531%. | `docs/history/BENCHMARK_REPORT.md` |
| — | Reported in the external master-build report (not reproducible from this repository): on fresh scenarios Karpenter+VPA sometimes used less modelled energy than Omni, while Omni had lower churn and fewer request-induced evictions. Kept here so it is not lost; to be re-run here before it is cited. | external |

## 48. The Claims Register



Every claim, its evidence status and the command that reproduces it. Simulation results use the synthetic stack model in omnicompass/stack_sim.py; they are not production measurements.

| ID | Claim | Status | Reproduce |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | The six-state mechanism is implemented identically in the reference engine, Python and C++. | Proven (exact parity tests) | `python verify.py` |
| C2 | The C++ governor reproduces the Python governor on recorded stack telemetry. | Proven (0 mismatches) | `python tests/test_cpp_governor_parity.py <oc_governor>` |
| C2s | The C++ shield reproduces the Python shield (enforced actions, intervention counts and violations) on action sets recorded from every arm type; a C++ shield with invariant I1 weakened is rejected by the parity test. | Proven (0 mismatches; negative control) | `python verify.py` |
| C2h | An independent C++ implementation of the HPA replica law (ratio rule, 10% tolerance, scale-up limit, 300 s scale-down window) reproduces the fleet harness HPA on every recorded step (hundreds of thousands of steps across Kubernetes and governor arms); a C++ HPA with 5% tolerance is rejected. | Proven (0 mismatches; negative control) | `python verify.py` |
| C3 | The S channel cannot cross S- (forward invariance). | Proven (Proposition 1) | `Manual Chapter 3` |
| C4 | The governor completed 100,000,000 consecutive decisions (951 years at 5-minute intervals) with 0 failures and constant memory; failure-rate upper bound 3.0e-08 at 95% confidence. | Measured (soak test); reproduced by the full verifier | `python verify.py` |
| C4b | Throughput-mode soak: 100,000,000 decisions, 0 failures; resident memory at 25/50/75/100% of each run is constant ([3852, 3852, 3852, 3852] kB power-protect, [3916, 3916, 3916, 3916] kB throughput). | Measured (soak test) | `python verify.py` |
| C8p | Primary endpoint (energy, throughput vs reference target 0.7): seed 346410161: -47.20 kWh, p = 1.0e-04; seed 360555127: -47.69 kWh, p = 1.0e-04. Secondary metrics Holm-adjusted over 24 tests: 21 better, 2 worse, 1 not significant. | Measured in simulation | `python benchmarks/multiplicity.py` |
| C5 | One governor decision costs 2.6 microseconds on one CPU core of the test machine (machine-dependent). | Measured | `cpp: oc_soak` |
| C6 | Observe mode leaves the stack bit-identical: over Kubernetes, identical to Kubernetes alone (500/500 and 500/500); over the native model, identical to native (500/500 and 500/500). | Measured in simulation | `results/heldout_seed_*` |
| C7 | Invariant violations per run (all arms scored identically): Kubernetes reference 9.56 / 9.44; power-protect 0.00 / 0.00; throughput 2.72 / 2.69, of which all are I4 (projected power), which throughput mode does not enforce; excluding I4: reference 6.91 / 6.80, throughput 0.00 / 0.00. | Measured in simulation | `results/heldout_seed_*` |
| C8 | Energy for Omni-Compass over Kubernetes (throughput mode, same power rules as the reference) versus the Kubernetes reference model (HPA target 0.7): 168.9 to 121.7 (better) / 169.2 to 121.5 (better) kWh per run; across HPA targets 0.5 to 0.8: better in 8, worse in 0, not significantly different in 0 of 8 seed-target combinations. | Measured in simulation (synthetic stack, documented-behaviour reference model) | `results/heldout_seed_*` |
| C9 | Time healthy for Omni-Compass over Kubernetes (throughput mode) versus the reference model (target 0.7): 79.3% to 91.2% (better) / 78.5% to 91.4% (better); across targets: better in 8, worse in 0, not significantly different in 0 of 8 seed-target combinations. | Measured in simulation | `results/heldout_seed_*` |
| C10 | Recovery time for Omni-Compass over Kubernetes (throughput mode) versus the reference model (target 0.7): 57.2 to 17.8 (better) / 58.4 to 15.2 (better) minutes; across targets: better in 8, worse in 0, not significantly different in 0 of 8 seed-target combinations. | Measured in simulation | `results/heldout_seed_*` |
| C11 | Backlog violations for Omni-Compass over Kubernetes (throughput mode) versus the reference model (target 0.7): 2.5% to 1.6% (better) / 2.6% to 1.5% (better); across targets: better in 8, worse in 0, not significantly different in 0 of 8 seed-target combinations. | Measured in simulation | `results/heldout_seed_*` |
| C12 | Machine round trips (started and later stopped), throughput mode versus the reference (target 0.7): 1.1 to 1.7 (worse) / 1.1 to 1.8 (worse) per run; across targets: better in 2, worse in 6, not significantly different in 0 of 8 seed-target combinations. The reference removes a machine only after 10 minutes below 50% utilization and keeps post-event machines running; the governor releases them, which is the main source of its energy saving. | Measured in simulation | `results/heldout_seed_*` |
| C12w | Scale direction reversals (back-and-forth wear), throughput mode versus the reference (target 0.7): 2.19 to 1.93 (better) / 2.22 to 1.92 (better) per run; across targets: better in 4, worse in 4, not significantly different in 0 of 8 seed-target combinations.

## 49. The Benchmark Report



> **Dated record, kept as written on 26 September 2026.** Where a figure here differs from `docs/STATE_OF_PLAY.md`, the State of Play governs. The GPU power-limit figure in this report (15% to 19% energy, under 1% slower) came from an earlier model of the card; later models with the service guards give +1.3% to +5.1% work per kJ with one wire (`results/gpu/sim/after`) and +8.6% with two wires at a higher p95 (`results/sim/gpu_two_wire/RESULT.md`). No real card had finished the bench on that date; the first card result (NVIDIA A10, 2026-10-02) is in `results/gpu/run-20261002T082232Z/GPU_REPS.md` and `docs/STATE_OF_PLAY.md`.

Benchmark report, 26 September 2026. Repository: Omni-Compass/The-Omni-Compass-Control-Core-Engine (private), branch main Every number below is produced by code in that repository and can be regenerated; section 21 gives the commands. Each result states whether it was **measured on a live Kubernetes control plane** or **computed in simulation**.

### 1. Summary

Omni-Compass is a single control engine that senses the whole compute stack and drives its actuators (its "muscles": replica counts, node pools, power caps and others) from one six-state dynamical model, with a safety shield before every action and a kill switch that hands control back. It was compared in three architectures:

- **A. Kubernetes alone.** Kubernetes' own controllers decide: Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) for replicas, Cluster Autoscaler for nodes; other managers act on their own proposals.
- **B. Kubernetes + Omni-Compass.** Kubernetes' controllers keep running; Omni-Compass governs on top of them (sets the HPA target, gates and sizes the node pool, caps power) as the single authority over their settings.
- **C. Omni-Compass direct.** Omni-Compass is the only decision-maker and actuates the muscles directly; the separate managers no longer decide.

**Main result (pre-registered, 1,000 held-out scenarios, simulation).** Against Kubernetes alone, B used -28% energy and C -23%; time healthy rose from 79% to 91% (B) and 90% (C); recovery time fell from 58 to 17 and 28 minutes; contradictory commands, pages and human interventions went to zero in both; safety-rule violations fell from 9.5 to 2.7 (B) and 0.0 (C). Of 28 gauges, B is significantly better on 20 and worse on 5; C is better on 16 and worse on 10.

**Live Kubernetes result (measured).** Two identical Kubernetes clusters (1 control plane + 6 workers) ran the same load at the same time, one without Omni-Compass and one with it. With Omni-Compass: worker nodes in service 6.0 to 3.2; utilisation of the workers in service 0.068 to 0.116. **Energy:** with the parked workers kept on standby, powered and ready (100 W each, the same as idle), energy was 219 vs 218 Wh (-0.46%): parking alone saves essentially nothing; energy per unit of work +8% (not significant; 872 to 944 Wh per core-hour, from minute averages). The -43% first reported for this run holds only if parked workers are powered off. Waiting pods and HPA shortfall were not significantly different. The kill switch restored the original HPA target (50) and all 6 workers. **With every live muscle switched on (section 7.2) the application got slower: p95 response time 486 to 802 ms, energy per unit of work +46% (significant).** The causes were found and fixed across runs 2-4 (section 7.4): response time went from +65% to a tie at p95.

**Where Omni-Compass costs something.** In the pre-registered study both B and C keep more node-hours powered than Kubernetes alone and start and stop machines more often (more wear), and move the power cap more; C also lets more work wait in the queue and flips scale direction more often. In that study the energy saving comes from power capping and load shaping, not from switching machines off. On the live cluster the saving came from switching machines off. Other limits: the small-cluster release band (section 11); power and heat on the live cluster are modelled, not metered.

**Trade-off in one line:** B is the strongest all-round result in simulation (energy, health, recovery, queue, coordination and safety all better; wear and node-hours worse); C is the strongest on peak power, heat and safety (zero invariant violations) at the cost of queue length, wear and flip-flops. These are the gauges to tune next.

### 2. What Omni-Compass is

#### 2.1 The engine
The engine is a six-state ordinary differential equation system, state x = (E, U, I_U, S, B, B_dot): error E, coherence U, pressure I_U, stress S and a damped bath B. The shipped core (`omnicompass/core.py`) integrates it with fourth-order Runge-Kutta and holds the control input constant across the four stages:

```
(1) dE/dt   = -alpha_E E + beta_int + beta_ext + v_eff
(2) dU/dt   = mu U (1 - U^2) - (dE/dt)/E_max - lambda_U U + u,   |u| <= 25
(3) dI_U/dt = (1 - U) - sigma_1 E - delta S - lambda_I I_U
(4) v_eff   = cos(omega_B t / 2) c tanh(lambda_0 + lambda_1 (U - 0.5) + lambda_2 S)
(5) Phi(S)  = alpha_s S^2/2 + beta_s S^3/4 - delta S
(6) dS/dt   = -dPhi/dS
(7) dB/dt = B_dot;  dB_dot/dt = gamma_c delta S - (omega_B/Q_B) B_dot - omega_B^2 B
(8) R_B[n]  = finite-difference audit of (7), never fed back
Controller: u = clip(-f_U(x,t) + 12 (sigma - U), -25, +25)
```
Telemetry (load, queue, power, heat, network, drift, staleness, security) is assimilated into the state each decision; an allocation law turns the state into a demand target rho* (the HPA target), a node change, and a power cap. Release of capacity is gated by equation (2): capacity is only released once the control push has converged.

#### 2.2 The nervous system (muscles)
Each muscle has five parts: afferent (pull: sense), the shared engine, efferent (push: act), reflex (the shield checks every push) and kill (hand the muscle back to its own controller). Status in this repository: **wired live on Kubernetes** (sense and push executed through kubectl, each with shield and kill): nodes, HPA target, power cap (in-place CPU limits, enforced by the kernel), security hold, deployment rollouts (pause, resume, undo), batch queue (admit held Jobs); **sensed**: heat (harness heat law on live power, or GPU temperature), network; **hardware connectors** (built and tested with fake hardware, off on CI machines): CPU power states (RAPL read, cpufreq ceiling) and GPU (nvidia-smi power and temperature read, power limit); **open** (registered, no plant yet): memory, storage, cooling, grid, training, inference, agent containment and the rest of the 52-muscle domain map (`docs/DOMAIN_MAP.md`). AI value alignment is explicitly not an Omni-Compass muscle. Code: `omni_controller/controller.py`, `omni_controller/muscles.py`, `omnicompass/nervous.py`.

#### 2.3 The shield and the kill switch
Before any action the shield (`omnicompass/shield.py`) enforces invariants I1 to I5: no expansion during a security block, node count within bounds, step limits, never below the capacity running and pending work needs, and the site power limit. The kill switch (a file or `OMNI_KILL=1`) restores every HPA target Omni-Compass changed from the recorded original, returns the node pool to its native size and drops to observe mode. Every decision and action is written to an append-only audit log.

#### 2.4 Operating modes
Observe (compute and log, write nothing), target (write HPA targets), nodepool (also size a node pool). Laws: power_protect (enforce the site power envelope), throughput (power envelope not enforced; capacity sized at full power) and fleet variants tuned on the 15-second fleet harness.

### 3. The three architectures, and how each study realises them

| Study | A. Kubernetes alone | B. Kubernetes + Omni-Compass | C. Omni-Compass direct | Live or simulated |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pre-registered held-out stack benchmark (2 x 500 scenarios) | `k8s_ref_70`: documented HPA law (target 0.7, 10% tolerance, 300 s stabilisation) and Cluster Autoscaler (scale-up on backlog, remove after 10 min under 50%), other managers act on their own proposals | `omni_k8s_throughput`: the same Kubernetes loops, Omni governs on top | `omni_direct`: Omni senses and actuates the stack directly | simulation |
| Control-plane replica (24 scenarios) | `hpa70_ca`: metrics-server, HPA and Cluster Autoscaler replicas at 15 s | `omni_target_gate_hpa70_ca`: Omni writes the HPA target and gates Cluster Autoscaler scale-down | `omni_throughput_full`: Omni writes the HPA target, owns node scale-down and power cap; the Cluster Autoscaler may only add nodes | simulation |
| PlanetLab-shaped demand, fleet plant (8 scenarios) | `k8s_hpa70_ca` | `omni_target`: Omni writes the HPA target | `omni_fleet`: Omni is the node-pool authority, Cluster Autoscaler off | simulation on recorded traces |
| Live kind cluster, side by side | native: HPA only, 6 workers always on, Omni not running | Omni on top: sets the HPA target and is the sole node-pool authority (cordon, drain, uncordon); Kubernetes' scheduler, kubelet and HPA still execute | not yet built live (section 16) | **live** |

### 4. Method and why the comparison is fair

- **Frozen before testing.** The allocation law, engine parameters, shield limits, modes, baselines and benchmark code were selected on development seeds (1000, 2000) and frozen, with SHA-256 hashes and program fingerprints in `results/PREREGISTRATION.json`, before any run on the held-out seeds 346410161 and 360555127. `verify.py` re-checks every hash.
- **Same scenarios for every arm.** Each scenario is run under every architecture; comparisons are paired scenario by scenario.
- **Observe-identity check.** Omni-Compass in observe mode must produce a trajectory bit-identical to the arm it observes, or the run is invalid. Held-out: 500 and 500 of 500 identical to the native stack, 500 and 500 of 500 identical to Kubernetes; control-plane replica: 24 of 24; PlanetLab: 8 of 8; live: 0 writes while observing.
- **Statistics.** Differences are paired (Omni minus Kubernetes on the same scenario) with 95% bootstrap confidence intervals. In the held-out study a difference is called better or worse only if the interval excludes zero in the same direction on both independent seeds; 'better in N' counts scenarios. Live results use 2-minute blocks and a bootstrap over blocks.
- **Ablations** show the engine, not an accident of tuning, produces the result (section 5.3).
- **Independent implementations.** A C++ engine, governor, shield and HPA law are checked against the Python ones (section 8).

### 5. Results: pre-registered held-out benchmark (1,000 scenarios, simulation)

#### 5.1 What the numbers say
- **Energy:** B -28%, C -23% versus Kubernetes alone, although both keep slightly more node-hours powered. The saving comes from power capping and load shaping: time over the power limit halves (B) or nearly vanishes (C), and C cuts peak power by a quarter. Releasing idle machines, which the live cluster showed, is not what drives this study; idle node-hours are a gauge to tune.
- **Reliability:** time healthy and recovery improve sharply in both B and C; the share of incidents recovered rises.
- **Coordination:** separate managers issue contradictory commands (A); a single authority issues none (B, C). Pages and human interventions go to zero because Omni-Compass acts on the conditions that would have paged someone.
- **Heat:** C cuts time over the heat limit the most, because it governs power caps and load together.
- **Costs:** node start/stop events rise (B +66%, C +102%), machine round trips rise, the power cap moves more, and C's queue and scale reversals are higher than Kubernetes alone. The 24-scenario control-plane study (section 6) shows the opposite for wear (fewer machine stops), so wear depends on the plant and law and is a primary tuning target. These are reported, not tuned away.

#### 5.2 Architecture A has a hidden cost: the fragmented stack without Kubernetes
For reference, the stack with each manager acting alone and no Kubernetes loops (`native`) used 131.9 kWh, was healthy 39% of the time, took 127 minutes to recover and produced 56.7 contradictory commands and 28.1 invariant violations per scenario. Kubernetes already improves on that; Omni-Compass improves on Kubernetes.

'no_dynamics' runs the same allocation law with equations (1) to (7) frozen; 'no_shield' removes the shield. The difference is full engine minus ablation: negative energy means the evolving dynamics save energy the frozen engine does not; the shield ablation shows what the shield prevents.

### 6. Results: Kubernetes control-plane replica (24 scenarios, simulation)

Replicas of the documented metrics-server, HPA (15 s) and Cluster Autoscaler (10 s) loops, with Karpenter-lite as a second Kubernetes reference; Omni-Compass decides every 300 s.

### 7. Results: live Kubernetes (measured)

#### 7.1 Side by side, two identical clusters at the same time
kind clusters (real Kubernetes API server, scheduler, kubelet, HPA and metrics-server), 1 control plane + 6 workers each; the official php-apache HPA workload (target 50); the same stepped load (1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1 load generators over 20 minutes after a 2-minute warm-up); capture every 15 s. Native: Omni-Compass not started. Omni: nodepool mode, HPA target, node pool, power sensing. Run 36209933218, 2026-09-26.

Omni-Compass decisions: nodes per minute 5 4 3 then 3 for the remaining 17 minutes; HPA target 78-79% (Kubernetes alone: 50%). Node-pool resizes: 3 (three workers cordoned and drained, their pods rescheduled by Kubernetes). Kill switch: HPA target restored to 50, 6 of 6 workers back in service.

#### 7.2 Live, side by side, every live muscle (run 36213152881 (2026-09-26 02:54-03:19 UTC))
Same two-cluster setup; the Omni arm drives HPA target, node pool, power cap (in-place pod CPU limits), heat (harness law on live power), security hold, rollout guard. Real response times: HTTP requests to the app timed every 5 s on both clusters. **This run made the application slower.**

Actions: hpa target writes 1, node pool resizes 3, power cap pod resizes 7, rollout actions 0, power cap per minute 0.695 every minute (the law floor), hpa target 77%, nodes 5 4 3 then 3. Kill switch: restored target 50; workers 6 of 6; pod CPU limits restored.

**Diagnosis:** The engine saw the cluster as idle (node utilisation about 7%) and had no response-time signal, so it capped the app pods at the law floor and packed replicas to a 77% target (5 instead of 10). The app pods were busy, so responses slowed. Fix wired: latency afferent (p95 over a declared 500 ms SLO enters as queue pressure) and a power-cap reflex (never below pod usage x 1.3); re-run pending.

#### 7.3 Other live runs
| Run | Setup | Result |
|---|---|---|

| live-kind-full, run 36205869009 | 1 control plane + 3 workers | node pool never resized: 3 of 3 every minute at about 8% utilisation, because the fleet law needs more than 3 nodes of slack; kill switch restored target and workers |
| live-kind-full, run 36207925928 | 1 control plane + 6 workers; sequential baseline then full engine | nodes in service 6 to 5 to 4 to 3; node-hours in service per core-hour -38.2%, utilisation +63.7% (significant); the reported kWh per core-hour -35.8% counted parked workers as powered off; with parked workers on standby the saving largely disappears; kill switch restored target 50 and 6 of 6 workers |

#### 7.4 Live runs after the first all-muscle run

| Run | Change tested | Validity | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 36214629046 (2026-09-26 03:23-03:48 UTC), commit c182a63 | latency afferent (p95 over 500 ms SLO as queue pressure) and power-cap usage reflex | valid | p95 481 to 600 (+24.6% worse); p99 596 to 777 (+30.3% worse); energy 222 to 219 (-1.5%) |

Run 3 is recorded as invalid: a refused Kubernetes call stopped the controller after 3 of 20 decisions and the cluster held Omni's last settings with no engine running. The fix is a fail-safe: a failed decision is skipped; three in a row restore native settings and stop the controller. In run 4 the fail-safe did exactly that at minute 16, and the audit showed why: the least-privilege role allowed writing a pod's CPU limit but not reading it first, which kubectl does. In runs 3 and 4 no power cap was ever applied. Over run 4's 16 governed minutes node-hours per unit of work fell 24% and utilisation rose 36% (both significant); median response time -10%, p95 a tie, p99 +6% (not significant). The permission is fixed (with a receipt) and a run in which the fail-safe fires is now rejected; the re-run is in progress.

### 8. Engineering verification

`python verify.py` runs 89 checks (0 failures in the recorded log `results/VERIFY_LOG.txt`), including:

- reference engine SHA-256
- core parity vs reference engine and 500 fixtures
- C++ core vs 500 fixtures  (max abs 3.55e-15)
- C++ governor vs Python governor (throughput)
- C++ shield vs Python shield (enforce and violations)
- negative control: parity test detects a C++ shield that no longer blocks rollouts during a security block
- independent C++ HPA replica law vs fleet harness HPA
- soak test (throughput), 100,000,000 decisions, no failures, memory flat after warm-up  (2899 ns per decision, RSS checkpoints [3840, 3840, 3840, 3840] kB)
- held-out seed 346410161: observe mode identical to native
- live controller against a fake cluster: observe writes nothing, target bounded, kill restores, node pool bounded and dry-run safe

Also tested: the live controller against a fake cluster (observe writes nothing; targets bounded; kill restores from the HPA annotation after a restart; node pool bounded and dry-run safe), the full-engine options (parked and control-plane nodes excluded; the kill switch restores the node pool exactly once) and pilot scoring (detects a real gain, reports no gain on identical clusters, detects a service regression).

### 9. Physics and models

- **Stack plant power:** each node draws idle 0.38 kW plus 1.12 kW x utilisation; a power cap throttles delivered capacity.
- **Heat:** thermal state follows a first-order lag toward 0.34 + 0.62 x power stress (time constant about 7 steps); heat above 0.82 throttles capacity; 'over the heat limit' means thermal above 1.03.
- **Live kind cluster:** kind nodes have no power meter, so power is a declared model: 100 W idle + 150 W x CPU utilisation per worker in service, plus a standby power for each parked (cordoned and drained) worker. Standby defaults to the idle power (the worker stays powered and ready); lower values apply only to a declared sleep state, zero only to machines really powered off. The first live reports counted parked workers as zero; section 7.1 gives both. The same constants drive the governor's power sense and the energy score, so they cannot disagree. On real hardware this is replaced by metered power (RAPL, PDU or BMC).
- **Savings model** (`results/SAVINGS.csv`): a 1,000-node web cluster at 0.4 kW per node, PUE 1.4, $0.12/kWh and 0.4 kg CO2/kWh; reduction versus HPA 0.7 + Karpenter-lite of 14% to 20% (fleet plant) gives roughly 710 to 960 MWh, $85,000 to $115,000 and 280 to 380 t CO2 per year.
- **Engine overhead:** about 2.9 microseconds per decision in C++, memory flat over 100 million decisions.

### 10. What is proven, what is simulated, what is not claimed

| Claim | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Engine equations are finite and deterministic; C++ equals Python | Proven | verify.py, 500 fixtures, max error 3.6e-15 |
| Observe mode changes nothing | Proven (simulation and live) | bit-identical trajectories; 0 writes live |
| Kill switch restores native control | Proven (simulation and live) | HPA target 50 and all workers restored live |
| Omni-Compass acts on a real Kubernetes control plane (HPA target, node pool) | Proven live | section 7 |
| Fewer nodes in service than Kubernetes with a fixed node pool, same load served | Measured live | section 7.1 |
| Lower energy on the live cluster | Not shown while parked nodes stay on standby; -22% to -43% only if parked nodes sleep or power off | section 7.1 |
| Better energy, health, recovery, coordination than Kubernetes (HPA + CA) | Pre-registered simulation | section 5 |
| Better than Karpenter-lite on energy | Simulation | sections 6, and PlanetLab fleet plant |
| Better than upstream Karpenter or Cluster Autoscaler binaries, live | Not yet tested | section 12 |
| Metered energy savings on physical servers | Not yet tested | power is modelled |
| GPU power-limit muscle saves 15-19% energy with <1% slower responses | Simulation calibrated to metered H100 data (MLPerf) | section 12 |
| CPU frequency muscle | Simulation (uncalibrated): about -3.5% energy, -67% heat | section 12 |
| Tuned laws remove wear and node-hour negatives (C-throughput) | Pre-registered amendment, new held-out data | section 13 |
| Cooling, grid, memory, storage and the other open muscles | Not claimed | no plant or connector yet |
| Makes AI models aligned or trustworthy | Not claimed | value alignment is outside Omni-Compass |

### 11. Limits and threats to validity

- Simulated studies use documented-behaviour replicas of Kubernetes controllers, not the upstream binaries; the Kubernetes reference omits Karpenter consolidation, VPA, scheduling constraints and disruption budgets.
- The live cluster is kind: nodes are containers on one CI machine; the two live arms ran on two machines at the same time, so machine-to-machine variation is part of the noise; each live arm is 20 minutes, one repetition.
- Live power and heat are modelled; parked kind workers are drained containers. If parked machines must stay on standby, parking reduces nodes in service but not energy; live energy savings then have to come from power caps, CPU power states and heat control, which are not yet wired live.
- The live native arm had no node autoscaler, so its node pool was always full; the fair live opponent is Karpenter or Cluster Autoscaler (section 16).
- The live significance for energy per core-hour with standby power is computed from minute averages (10 two-minute blocks), not from the 15-second capture.
- The fleet law releases a node only when the pool has more than three nodes of slack; a three-worker pool cannot scale down (observed live, reproduced offline). Small clusters need a pool-size-aware release band.
- Architecture C was measured in simulation only; the live C (Kubernetes' controllers parked, Omni-Compass as the only brain) is not built yet.
- Service quality differences in the live runs (pending pods, HPA shortfall) are not statistically significant at this run length.

### 12. GPU and CPU muscles: device plant calibrated to metered hardware (simulation)

The GPU power-limit and CPU frequency muscles cannot be actuated on CI machines (no GPU; the hypervisor hides RAPL and cpufreq). Their connectors are built (section 2.2) and this plant shows what they do. **GPU calibration:** the performance-versus-power-limit exponent is fitted to MLPerf Inference v4.0 results for an NVIDIA DGX-H100 (8 x H100-SXM, 700 W TDP), MaxQ (power-limited with `nvidia-smi -pl`, the same command the Omni-Compass GPU connector sends) versus MaxP, system power metered by a Yokogawa WT333E; Apache 2.0. Fitted exponent 0.353 to 0.490 (median 0.449); all three are run. **CPU:** a standard first-order model (dynamic power ~ frequency cubed) against a schedutil-style governor; not calibrated to metered data yet. **S** is a fixed manual 70% cap, what an operator could do by hand. 24 scenarios, 8 load families; * = paired 95% interval excludes zero.

**Reading:** on GPUs Omni-Compass saves 15-19% energy across the measured range with response time 0.6-0.8% slower; a fixed cap saves about the same energy but slows responses 30-63% and misses the service target. On CPUs the native governor already tracks demand, so frequency control alone saves about 3.5%; its main effect is heat (-67%). CPU frequency control is below the 10% bar and is a physical ceiling of that muscle, not a tuning gap.

### 13. Amendment: tuned laws, frozen, then tested on new held-out data (simulation)

Two law variants were tuned on the development seeds only (1000, 2000; `tuning/SEARCH*.json`), frozen with SHA-256 hashes in `tuning/PREREGISTRATION_AMENDMENT_2026-09-26.json` and pushed (commit b79d1dd, 03:17 UTC) before a single run on new held-out seeds 731001 and 731002 (2 x 500 scenarios). The frozen engine files are unchanged; the original pre-registered result (section 5) stays the primary result. B-wear: node release held longer. C-throughput: Omni-Compass direct under the throughput law with a wider release band and engine-gated cap. + better, ! worse (both seeds agree), blank not significant.

Worse gauges: B_frozen 5, B_wear 4, C_frozen 10, C_throughput 5.

### 14. Response time: can one mode beat Kubernetes on every gauge? (simulation, development seeds)

The fleet-mode constants that drove the live runs were selected (before this work) by a rule that scored energy, finished work and backlog, but never waiting time. A response-time gauge was added to the fleet plant (fleet/sim_slo.py: M/M/c queueing delay per workload plus backlog drain; the frozen trace is reproduced exactly). Measured with it, fleet mode cut energy 31% on web services while p95 response time went from 132 ms to about 20 s. That is where the live slowdown came from: its HPA target floor (rho_min = 76.9%) packs pods too hot for latency-sensitive services.

A speed-first law (omnicompass/speed.py; the engine equations unchanged) separates the two jobs the frozen law gave one number: pods run at a latency-safe target while machines are sized to what the pods request. 400 configurations were searched against HPA 70% + Cluster Autoscaler with the rule that no gauge may be worse in any development scenario. None passed, for three measured reasons: (1) several gauges are already at their physical floor (100% work done, zero violations, batch p95 = pure service time), so a tie is the best any controller can do; (2) on the GPU vessel demand exceeds the hardware, so every arm is saturated; (3) energy, response time and machine churn trade two-of-three, because the autoscaler's idle slack is both where the energy is and what absorbs the 90-second boot delay. Examples, mean change vs Kubernetes: fleet mode energy -31% with far worse response time; speed #176 energy -1%, p99 -41%, churn 3.6x; speed #159 p99 -48%, churn -27%, energy +16%. Source: tuning/SPEED_FINDINGS_2026-09-26.md.

### 15. Named products: OpenShift, Google GKE, Azure AKS, IBM Turbonomic (simulation, development seeds)

Each product is emulated from its documented behaviour on the same fleet plant (not the vendors' binaries): OpenShift's documented ClusterAutoscaler example (threshold 0.4, unneeded 5 min, delay after add 10 min); GKE optimize-utilization (MostAllocated packing, more aggressive scale-down; declared as threshold 0.65, 2 min, because Google publishes no numbers); AKS node auto-provisioning (Karpenter, WhenEmptyOrUnderutilized, consolidateAfter 0 s); Turbonomic (container requests resized every 10 min to p99 per-pod usage, its default aggressiveness; nodes suspended toward 0.7 packing). Means over web services, 4 development seeds:

| Gauge (web) | Kubernetes (GKE balanced) | OpenShift | GKE optimize | AKS NAP | Turbonomic | Omni fleet mode | Omni speed #159 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| energy (kWh) | 12.19 | 12.53 | 10.4 | 9.779 | 10.08 | 8.392 | 15.9 |
| p95 (ms) | 131.6 | 131.6 | 132.2 | 132.7 | 125.1 | 2.034e+04 | 112.3 |
| p99 (ms) | 3,095 | 2,815 | 3,947 | 4,295 | 4.94e+04 | 7.634e+04 | 129.8 |
| machine starts+stops | 10.5 | 8.5 | 14.75 | 19 | 11.5 | 13.25 | 6.75 |
| scale reversals | 1.5 | 0.75 | 3.5 | 6 | 1.5 | 4.25 | 1 |

Every product sits on the same energy / response-time / churn triangle; none wins all three. Karpenter-style consolidation (AKS NAP) saves about 20% energy with a worse p99 tail and about twice the machine churn; Turbonomic's p99 resizing interacts with the HPA and inflates the tail; OpenShift's documented settings sit close to upstream. Omni's speed mode leads on response time and churn at an energy cost; its fleet mode leads on energy at a large response-time cost.

### 16. The problem-map muscles: all nine built and tested on held-out data (simulation)

Each open row of the industry problem map (section 18) is now a muscle in omnilab/, with the strongest native tool as opponent, Omni-Compass, and Omni-Compass with its engine equations not evolved (to show what the equations themselves add). Constants were chosen on development seeds 1-8, every file was frozen by SHA-256 (results/muscles/PREREGISTRATION.json), then 30 held-out seeds were run once. Verdicts from a paired bootstrap 95% interval.

| Muscle (map row) | Strongest native opponent | Omni better | Omni worse | Tie / not significant |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Right-sizing, HPA+VPA conflict (1, 2) | hpa_vpa | cpu core hours -3%; mem gib hours -11%; p99 ms -99%; replica reversals -84%; slo breach min -57% | p95 ms +15%; oom kills +531% | work done |
| Cold start (5) | keda | p95 ms -75%; p99 ms -58%; delayed 1s pct -71%; instance hours -8% | cold starts +736% | - |
| GPU packing (6) | binpack | energy kwh -2%; idle gpu hours powered -20% | wait mean min +16%; migrations 0 to 6.07 | wait p95 min, frag blocked min, jobs done |
| Training power swings (7) | floor_safe | energy overhead pct -9%; throughput loss pct -44%; swing 1s mw -6% | max ramp mw s +127% | ramp violation s |
| GPU failures and stragglers (8) | detect | goodput pct +10%; lost gpu hours -20%; restarts -29%; straggler node hours -99% | - | checkpoint overhead pct |
| Cooling (10) | reset | pue -2%; cooling mwh -13%; inlet violation min -73% | - | max inlet c |
| LLM inference, KV cache (12) | keda | ttft p95 s -18%; slo breach pct -58%; gpu hours -19%; preemptions -56% | - | ttft p50 s, tpot p95 ms |
| Runaway AI agents (13) | static | rogue overspend usd -96%; time to contain min -99%; peak subagents -59% | false stops +357%; honest work pct -7% | forbidden executed |
| Energy attribution in VMs (11) | ratio | attr error pct -37%; worst vm error pct -34% | - | total error pct |

Each entry is the plain change of Omni-Compass against the opponent (for example p99 -99% means the slow tail is 99% shorter; goodput +10% means 10% more useful training time). Worse entries are real costs, not rounding: right-sizing trades a slightly slower typical response (p95 +15%, both far under the 500 ms target) and a few more memory kills for a 99% shorter tail; cold start keeps fewer idle instances than KEDA's 5-minute cooldown, so more requests meet a cold start, but users wait far less because KEDA polls every 30 s; GPU packing powers idle GPUs off sooner and jobs wait a few seconds longer; containment throttles honest agents in their legitimate bursts (about 7% of their work) and stops about two honest agents a day, against a 96% cut in runaway spend and containment in minutes instead of hours. Against the other native arms (the default tools most teams run) the wins are larger; every comparison is in results/muscles/*_HELDOUT.json.

**What the engine itself contributes.** Across the nine muscles the full engine and the engine-not-evolved arm differ by 1.0 percentage points on average per gauge. The mapping from engine state to action carries most of each result; the evolved dynamics mainly smooth. In power smoothing an arm where the bath equation (7) alone sets the site's draw, with no ramp rule, cut the steepest ramp 63% but did not hold the grid's limit: the human sets the boundary, the engine operates inside it.

### 17. Every negative, its cause and its status

| Negative | Where | Status | Cause | What would fix it |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Node start/stop cycles (wear) | B, pre-registered | reduced (+65% to +34%), not removed | node release thresholds are fixed numbers | hybrid: Kubernetes serves the queue, Omni releases nodes with the C-throughput law (removed wear there: -50%) |
| Node start/stop, round trips, reversals | C, pre-registered | fixed in C-throughput (new held-out) | power-protect law released nodes too eagerly | adopted in C-throughput |
| Node-hours and idle node-hours | B and C, pre-registered | fixed in C-throughput (-10%, -23%); not in B | power capping trades lower watts for more servers on | hybrid as above; node-aware cap |
| Queue / backlog / availability -0.3% | C (both variants) | UNRESOLVED | not the replica law and not the sizing constants (both tested); likely the delayed observation or direct-mode proposals | trace one scenario step by step; candidate: feed the queue into the engine without the extra delay |
| Power-cap movement | B and C | inherent | moving the cap is how capping saves energy; freezing it removed most of the saving (tested: -28% to -2%/-7%) | none needed: electronic setting, no physical wear; reported |
| CPU frequency saving 3.5% | device plant | physical ceiling | the native Linux governor already follows demand | value is in heat (-67%) and in combining with power caps |
| GPU node on/off saving 3% | fleet plant | superseded | training nodes cannot be switched off | the GPU power-limit muscle (15-19%) |
| Live response time +65% (p95) and energy per unit of work +46% with every muscle | live kind, run 36213152881 | reduced to p95 +25% (run 2), tie in run 4 | no response-time afferent; cap held at the law floor; HPA target floor 76.9% | latency afferent, cap reflex, SLO reflex; speed-first law (section 14) |
| Fleet mode p95 20 s vs 132 ms on web services | fleet plant with response-time gauge | cause found; speed-first law built | fleet constants were selected without a response-time gauge; HPA target floor 76.9% | choose the mode per service: speed-first where latency matters |
| No mode better than Kubernetes on every gauge in every scenario | fleet plant, 400 configurations | not achievable as posed | gauges at physical floors; hardware-bound GPU vessel; energy / response time / churn trade two-of-three | anticipation (pre-adding machines before the daily rise) is the one untested mechanism that could break the trade |
| Controller stopped after one refused call; power cap never applied under least privilege | live runs 3 and 4 | fixed | one exception ended the loop; the role lacked get on pods/resize | fail-safe restore after 3 failures; permission and receipt added; runs with a fail-safe rejected |
| Right-sizing p95 +15%, more memory kills than VPA | omnilab rightsize, held-out | open, small | Omni sizes CPU closer to demand; VPA's 8-hour p90 memory keeps more slack | larger memory margin (costs memory-hours) |
| More cold starts than KEDA | omnilab coldstart, held-out | trade-off | shorter keep-alive than KEDA's 5-minute cooldown | longer keep-alive where cold starts matter more than instance-hours |
| GPU jobs wait +16% (seconds) vs Volcano binpack | omnilab gpupack, held-out | trade-off | idle GPUs powered off sooner | longer power-off delay |
| Honest agents throttled (-7% work) and ~2 false stops a day vs static caps | omnilab containment, held-out | trade-off | throttling on the engine's integrated need catches legitimate bursts | per-agent declared burst budgets; human approval before stop |
| Engine dynamics add little beyond the mapping | all nine muscles | reported | the mapping from state to action carries the effect | wire the engine's control effort (equation 2) directly as the actuator command and test it |
| Live energy with parked servers on standby ~0% | live kind | open | parked servers still draw standby power | live power cap and CPU/GPU muscles; sleep states where hardware allows |
| Small clusters (<= 3 workers) never release | live kind | open | fleet law release band of 3 nodes | pool-size-aware release band (law change) |
| Pages in the 24-scenario replica | control-plane replica | open | longer queue triggers the page rule | same as queue |

### 18. The industry problem map: what Omni-Compass is aimed at

One engine; the vessel (the plant it sits on) is the only thing that changes. Industry figures are approximate, from the public sources named, and are context, not results of this report. Status: **live** = measured on a real Kubernetes control plane; **sim** = demonstrated in this repository's simulations; **open** = mapped, connector not built.

| Problem | Scale in the industry (approximate, source) | Best software today | Omni-Compass vessel and muscles | Gauge that shows it | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Data-centre electricity growth | about 415 TWh in 2024, about 1.5% of world electricity, projected near 945 TWh by 2030 (IEA, Energy and AI, 2025) | Karpenter, Cluster Autoscaler, CAST AI, Spot Ocean; Kepler for metering | compute vessel: nodes, HPA, power cap | energy, node-hours, idle node-hours | sim; live only where parked nodes can sleep or power off |
| Idle and over-provisioned capacity | Kubernetes clusters commonly run near 10-15% average CPU utilisation (CAST AI and Datadog industry reports); roughly a quarter to a third of cloud spend reported as waste (Flexera State of the Cloud) | VPA, Goldilocks, StormForge, Kubecost/OpenCost | compute vessel: nodes, HPA; requests and memory (omnilab/rightsize.py) | utilisation, node-hours per core-hour, core- and GiB-hours | live + sim |
| Controllers fighting each other | documented conflicts, e.g. HPA and VPA on the same CPU metric (Kubernetes documentation advises against it) | none: each tool decides alone | single authority over replicas and requests | contradictory commands, scale reversals, OOM kills | sim, held-out (section 16) |
| Outages and slow recovery | most significant outages cost over $100,000 (Uptime Institute annual outage analysis) | Argo Rollouts, Flagger, SRE runbooks, AIOps (Dynatrace, Datadog) | compute vessel + deployments (partial) | time healthy, recovery time, SLA breaches | sim |
| On-call load and alert fatigue | widely reported burnout in SRE surveys | PagerDuty, alert tuning | all muscles: act before the page | pages, human interventions | sim |
| Heat and cooling limits | cooling is a large share of facility energy; average PUE about 1.5 (Uptime Institute survey) | DCIM (Schneider EcoStruxure), DeepMind cooling AI (reported about 40% less cooling energy) | heat (sensed), cooling plant (omnilab/cooling.py) | PUE, cooling energy, inlet violations | sim, held-out (section 16) |
| Site power and grid-connection limits | multi-year waits for new grid connections are widely reported | Meta Dynamo power capping, Intel RAPL | power cap (wired), batteries and demand response (open) | peak power, time over power limit | sim |
| GPU energy and power limits | GPU fleets widely reported well below full utilisation; H100 TDP 700 W | NVIDIA DCGM and MIG, Run:ai, Kueue; manual MaxQ power limits | GPU power-limit muscle (hardware connector) | energy per unit of work, response time, heat | sim, calibrated to MLPerf metered H100 data: -15% to -19% energy, +0.6-0.8% response time |
| Batch deadlines and fair sharing |  | Kueue, Volcano, Slurm | batch muscle (live: admit held jobs); GPU packing (omnilab/gpupack.py) | queue wait, fragmentation | live wired + sim, held-out |
| Hardware wear | power cycling and churn shorten component life | none as a governed objective | nodes: start/stop cycles and reversals | machines started and stopped, round trips | mixed: better in the 24-scenario study, worse in the held-out study; tuning target |
| Carbon reporting and reduction | regulatory disclosure is expanding | Google carbon-aware computing, Kepler | carbon-aware placement (open) | kWh and CO2 per unit of work | sim (modelled) |
| Runaway AI agents and spend | ~$10,000 overnight examples (Dark Reading) | per-tool quotas and permissions | agent containment muscle (omnilab/containment.py) | rogue spend, time to contain, false stops | sim, held-out (section 16) |

### 19. What comes next

- Live architecture C: park HPA, VPA, Cluster Autoscaler and Karpenter; Omni-Compass sets replicas, resources, placement, priorities and quotas directly; Kubernetes keeps execution and reflexes (restarts, rescheduling); the kill switch wakes the parked controllers.
- Live opponent at full strength: Karpenter (kwok provider) and Cluster Autoscaler in architecture A.
- 24 live scenarios (traffic, failures, power and heat limits, batch and AI, growth, mixed) with repetitions.
- More muscles two-way: CPU power states, memory, batch queues, network, security, then GPU and cooling on hardware.
- Metered power on physical machines.

### 20. Questions and answers

**Does Omni-Compass replace Kubernetes?** No. Kubernetes keeps running containers, placing pods, restarting failures and networking. Omni-Compass replaces the separate decision loops (how many replicas, how many nodes, what power) with one authority. In architecture C Kubernetes becomes one muscle.

**What happens if Omni-Compass crashes or is switched off?** The kill switch restores every setting it changed and returns control to Kubernetes' own controllers; this was exercised live and in simulation. A crashed controller writes nothing further.

**Can it make things worse?** Every action passes the shield first; it never goes below the capacity running and pending work needs, and never changes more than the step limit. In the held-out benchmark it had fewer safety violations than Kubernetes. Its real costs are listed in sections 1 and 5.1.

**How fast does it decide, and what does it cost to run?** One decision per 60 s on live Kubernetes (300 s in the replica), with a 15 s fast path that adds nodes for pending pods. The engine takes about 2.9 microseconds per decision.

**Why does it save energy?** In the pre-registered stack study mainly by power capping and load shaping (fewer minutes over the power limit, lower peak), while keeping slightly more machines on. On the live cluster it took machines out of service (6 to 3 workers) and packed replicas more densely; that saves energy only if the parked machines sleep or power off. With parked machines on standby the live saving was about zero, so live savings must come from power caps and CPU power states.

**Does it slow applications down?** It can, in the energy-first fleet mode: its HPA target floor packs pods too hot for latency-sensitive services (section 14). Live, the first all-muscle run was slower (p95 +65%); after the fixes run 4 was a tie at p95 and 10% faster at the median. For latency-sensitive services the speed-first mode is the right setting.

**Can Omni-Compass control AI agents?** It controls what an agent can touch, spend and do, and how fast; not what the model thinks. In the containment muscle (section 16) it cut runaway spend 96% and contained runaways in minutes instead of hours, with a least-privilege identity that blocks forbidden actions outright; the cost is some throttling of honest agents' bursts.

**Does the engine hold everything in its basin by itself?** Not against an outside limit it is not told. The bath equation alone smoothed training power ramps 63% but did not keep them under the grid's limit; with the human-set limit as the boundary it held it with zero violations. The human sets the boundaries; the engine operates inside them.

**Is this tuned to the test?** Parameters were selected on development seeds and frozen with hashes before the held-out seeds were run; verify.py fails if any frozen file changes.

**How many scenarios and how certain?** 1,000 pre-registered held-out scenarios, 24 control-plane scenarios, PlanetLab traces and live runs; 95% bootstrap intervals, two independent seeds must agree.

**What is measured versus modelled?** Live: node counts, replicas, pods, CPU, the controller's actions and the kill switch. Modelled: power and heat everywhere, and everything in the simulated studies.

**Is the mathematics sound?** The core is a closed six-state system integrated with RK4; the C++ and Python implementations agree to 3.6e-15 on 500 reference trajectories; 100 million decisions ran without a non-finite value.

**Who owns it and how can it be used?** The Omni-Compass LLC. Free for evaluation, research and non-commercial use; commercial use requires a paid licence; protected by copyright and by patents and patent applications (see LICENSE and NOTICE).

**What is not claimed?** Superiority over upstream Karpenter or Cluster Autoscaler live, metered savings on physical hardware, GPU or facility control on real hardware, the vendor products' own binaries (they are emulated from documentation), and anything about AI value alignment.

**How do I check it myself?** Run the commands in section 21; the live runs are GitHub Actions workflows in the repository.

## 50. The Referee Report



> **Dated record, kept as written on 26 September 2026.** Where a figure here differs from `docs/STATE_OF_PLAY.md`, the State of Play governs. The results below are simulations of platforms (evidence class S), not measurements of those products.

Referee report, 26 September 2026. Repository Omni-Compass/The-Omni-Compass-Control-Core-Engine, branch main, commit 096956a. Every number is generated by `python tools/abc_report.py` from result files in the repository. Each result states how it was obtained: **measured** on a live Kubernetes control plane, **simulated** in this repository's plants, or **emulated** (a competitor reproduced from its public documentation, not its binary).

**Engine interpretation notice.** The Omni-Compass engine is the completed core conveyance mechanism; its success criterion is internal dual-basin conveyance under native ignition dynamics. Everything measured here (the Kubernetes adapters, the closure governor, the vendor comparisons) is wiring around the engine, which is downstream engineering and not part of the base law. A loss in a cell below is a property of that wiring on that plant, not evidence that the base engine is incomplete. The engine source is byte-locked by SHA-256 and was not edited for any result in this report.

### 1. The answer

Three architectures were measured against seven platforms: Kubernetes, Red Hat OpenShift, Google GKE, Azure AKS (node auto-provisioning, which is Karpenter and also stands for Amazon EKS Auto Mode), IBM Turbonomic, CAST AI and Spot Ocean.

- **A. The platform alone.** Its own autoscalers decide.
- **B. Omni-Compass on top of the platform.** The platform's controllers keep running; the six-state engine governs on top.
- **C. Omni-Compass alone.** The engine is the single authority; the platform's managers do not decide.

**B against A (held-out, 30 unseen scenarios per workload, settings frozen by SHA-256 first):** 363 of 364 gauge-by-platform-by-workload cells are equal or better; 1 is worse: batch jobs on CAST AI, scale reversals 7.7% worse. Batch jobs gain most: the slowest jobs finish much sooner on every platform (section 5.3). Where no intervention was free (web services, four clusters) Omni-Compass reproduces the platform exactly.

**C against the seven platforms at once (held-out):** 63 cells where some platform is better (section 6). Part of that gap is not closable by any controller: a perfect controller that knows the future cannot have both the tightest packer's machine-hours and the laziest autoscaler's machine churn (section 6.2).

**C with the manuscript's closure law and muscle tone (held-out, 30 unseen scenarios per workload, settings frozen first):** 41 of 364 cells where some platform is better. Against Kubernetes alone: web services energy +20%, slowest responses (p99) +60%, average response +20%; four clusters, one site energy +22%, slowest responses (p99) -19%, average response +11%; batch jobs energy +6%, slowest responses (p99) +6%, average response -6%; GPU training energy +1%, slowest responses (p99) +0%, average response +0% (positive = better; section 6.4).

**Live Kubernetes (measured, run 36221702999, every muscle on, B architecture):** worker machines 6.00 to 3.19, energy -3.2% with parked machines on standby, response time p95 491 to 383 ms and p99 613 to 491 ms, 0 failed requests; one significant negative (energy per CPU core-hour, section 7).

### 2. The rule, and how a cell is judged

- A **cell** is one gauge, one competitor, one workload. There are 13 gauges: energy, machine-hours, response time (p95, p99, mean), time over the backlog, power and heat limits, machine starts+stops, scale reversals, pod changes, work completed and time healthy.
- Omni-Compass **loses** a cell when it is worse by more than 0.5% (0.5 events for counts) **and** the paired bootstrap 95% interval of the per-scenario difference excludes zero. Otherwise the cell is equal (identical, or not significantly different) or better.
- Settings are chosen on **development** scenarios only, frozen with SHA-256 hashes (`tuning/B_PREREGISTRATION*.json`, `results/muscles/PREREGISTRATION.json`), then run once on **held-out** scenarios never used for tuning.
- Scenario generator: `fleet/harness.py` (15-second resolution, 6 hours; boot delay, power model, thermal model, site power limit identical for every arm). Response time: M/M/c queueing per workload plus backlog drain (`fleet/sim_slo.py`).

### 3. The opponents, and how each is reproduced

| Platform | What decides | Reproduced as (parameters) |
|---|---|---|
| Kubernetes | HPA + Cluster Autoscaler | HPA 70%; remove a node after 10 min below 50% request use, not within 10 min of an add |
| OpenShift | ClusterAutoscaler resource | documented example: threshold 0.4, unneeded 5 min, delay after add 10 min |
| GKE (optimize-utilization) | MostAllocated packing, aggressive scale-down | declared: threshold 0.65, 2 min (Google publishes no numbers) |
| AKS NAP (= Karpenter, EKS Auto Mode) | consolidation WhenEmptyOrUnderutilized | consolidateAfter 0 s; remove when the rest hold all requests at 90% packing |
| IBM Turbonomic | market-based resize + suspend | requests resized every 10 min to per-pod p99 usage; nodes suspended toward 70% packing |
| CAST AI | Evictor bin-packing | every 60 s, drain a node older than 5 min when its pods fit elsewhere |
| Spot Ocean | headroom autoscaler | 5% automatic headroom kept; least-used node removed when pods fit elsewhere |

These are emulations of documented behaviour on the same plant, not the vendors' software; each vendor's full product has more features than its autoscaling core. Every platform runs its pods at the same HPA target (70%), so pod behaviour is identical and differences come from how machines are managed.

### 4. What Omni-Compass is, mechanically

A six-state dynamical system, x = (E, U, I_U, S, B, B_dot): energy/excitation, order (a double-well with a healthy basin at U = +1), integrated unmet need, stress (a cubic potential), and a damped second-order bath. Equations (1)-(8) and every term's role are in `docs/MECHANISM_OF_ACTION.md`. Telemetry is blended into the state (weight 0.339) and the equations are integrated with RK4 each decision.

| Mode (Jacobian eigenvalue at the operating point) | Time constant (decisions) | Period (decisions) |
|---|---:|---:|
| -7.90+0.00i | 1.3 |  |
| -3.10+0.00i | 3.2 |  |
| -0.72+0.00i | 13.9 |  |
| -0.20+0.98i | 50.0 | 64 |
| -0.20-0.98i | 50.0 | 64 |
| -0.17+0.00i | 59.8 |  |

All modes are stable: the operating point (U = 0.976) sits inside the healthy basin. The equations and the observation blend each move the state about half of every step. Compute: 95 microseconds per decision in Python, about 3 in the C++ twin.

### 5. B: Omni-Compass on top of each platform, against the same platform alone (held-out)

Source `tuning/B_LEAGUE_HELDOUT2.json`. Omni-Compass keeps the platform running and intervenes only where the engine sees it will pay: it undoes a machine removal that is about to be reversed (while requests are rising or the engine has not converged), and adds early the machine the platform would add only after pods go pending. With both off it reproduces the platform exactly (checked on every platform and workload); every gain below is on top of that floor.

#### 5.1 Web services

Setting: pass-through. Every intervention tried here cost some gauge on some platform, so Omni-Compass leaves these decisions to the platform and the result is identical to the platform alone.

| Platform | Better (significant) | Worse beyond tolerance (LOSS) | Worse within 0.5% tolerance | Equal |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Kubernetes | - | - | - | 13 of 13 |

#### 5.3 Batch jobs

Setting per platform (chosen on development scenarios): Kubernetes: early add (lead 12, trend over 16), reversal veto; OpenShift: early add (lead 12, trend over 16), reversal veto; GKE (optimize): early add (lead 6, trend over 8), reversal veto; AKS NAP (Karpenter): early add (lead 3, trend over 16), reversal veto; Turbonomic: early add (lead 6, trend over 4), reversal veto; CAST AI: early add (lead 12, trend over 16), reversal veto; Spot Ocean: early add (lead 3, trend over 16), reversal veto.

| Platform | Better (significant) | Worse beyond tolerance (LOSS) | Worse within 0.5% tolerance | Equal |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Kubernetes | response p99 -91%; response mean -23%; machine starts+stops -16%; scale reversals -70% | - | - | 9 of 13 |
| OpenShift | response p99 -91%; response mean -25%; machine starts+stops -23%; scale reversals -87% | - | - | 9 of 13 |

#### 5.4 Gpu training

Setting per platform (chosen on development scenarios): Kubernetes: early add (lead 3, trend over 8), reversal veto; OpenShift: early add (lead 3, trend over 16); GKE (optimize): pass-through; AKS NAP (Karpenter): pass-through; Turbonomic: early add (lead 3, trend over 8); CAST AI: pass-through; Spot Ocean: pass-through.

| Platform | Better (significant) | Worse beyond tolerance (LOSS) | Worse within 0.5% tolerance | Equal |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Kubernetes | - | - | - | 13 of 13 |
| OpenShift | - | - | time over heat limit +0.1% | 12 of 13 |
| GKE (optimize) | - | - | - | 13 of 13 |
| AKS NAP (Karpenter) | - | - | - | 13 of 13 |
| Turbonomic | - | - | energy +0.1%; time over heat limit +0.2%; machine-hours +0.4% | 10 of 13 |
| CAST AI | - | - | - | 13 of 13 |
| Spot Ocean | - | - | - | 13 of 13 |

Percentages are the plain change of Omni-Compass on top against the platform alone: for response times, starts+stops, reversals, energy and machine-hours negative is better; for work completed and time healthy positive is better. A LOSS is worse beyond the 0.5% tolerance with a 95% interval excluding zero (section 2).

### 6. C: Omni-Compass alone, against all seven platforms at once

Source `tuning/LEAGUE_HELDOUT.json`. One Omni-Compass configuration per workload type (chosen on development scenarios): web: speed159, multi: speed159, batch: speed112, gpu: omni_fleet.

| Workload | Gauge | Platforms better than Omni-Compass | Omni worse by (range) |
|---|---|---|---|
| batch | energy | GKE (optimize), AKS NAP (Karpenter), Turbonomic, CAST AI, Spot Ocean | 1.7% to 6.7% |
| batch | machine-hours | GKE (optimize), AKS NAP (Karpenter), Turbonomic, CAST AI, Spot Ocean | 4.4% to 18.0% |
| batch | scale reversals | Kubernetes, OpenShift | 266.7% to 279.3% |
| batch | machine starts+stops | Kubernetes, OpenShift | 54.3% to 64.9% |
| gpu | machine-hours | GKE (optimize), AKS NAP (Karpenter), Turbonomic, CAST AI, Spot Ocean | 5.5% to 14.4% |
| gpu | scale reversals | Kubernetes, OpenShift | 85.6% to 87.6% |
| gpu | machine starts+stops | Kubernetes, OpenShift | 37.6% to 49.8% |
| multi | energy | Kubernetes, OpenShift, GKE (optimize), AKS NAP (Karpenter), Turbonomic, CAST AI, Spot Ocean | 23.9% to 64.7% |
| multi | machine-hours | Kubernetes, OpenShift, GKE (optimize), AKS NAP (Karpenter), Turbonomic, CAST AI, Spot Ocean | 36.7% to 119.0% |
| multi | pod changes | Kubernetes, OpenShift, GKE (optimize), AKS NAP (Karpenter), CAST AI, Spot Ocean | 8.2% to 10.3% |
| web | energy | Kubernetes, OpenShift, GKE (optimize), AKS NAP (Karpenter), Turbonomic, CAST AI, Spot Ocean | 23.9% to 63.5% |
| web | machine-hours | Kubernetes, OpenShift, GKE (optimize), AKS NAP (Karpenter), Turbonomic, CAST AI, Spot Ocean | 36.8% to 116.3% |
| web | pod changes | Kubernetes, OpenShift, GKE (optimize), AKS NAP (Karpenter), CAST AI, Spot Ocean | 7.8% to 10.8% |

#### 6.1 Where C wins

- Web services: response p95 110.1 ms vs best platform 124.9 ms; response p99 122.8 ms vs best platform 546 ms; response mean 145.3 ms vs best platform 216.2 ms.
- Four clusters, one site: response p95 112.1 ms vs best platform 126.9 ms; response p99 137.8 ms vs best platform 262.9 ms; response mean 145.6 ms vs best platform 217.2 ms.
- Batch jobs: response p99 337.4 ms vs best platform 1277 ms; response mean 115.2 ms vs best platform 135.6 ms.

#### 6.2 The physical limit: what no controller can do

For each scenario, dynamic programming with perfect knowledge of the future (boot delay ignored, which only helps it) finds the fewest machine starts+stops that can hold every pod at a given machine-hour budget (`tuning/bound.py`).

| Workload | Scenario | Tightest platform machine-hours | Fewest starts+stops of any platform | Perfect controller at those machine-hours |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| web | 101 | 18.4 | 9 | 11 |
| web | 102 | 18.3 | 9 | 9 |
| web | 103 | 31.4 | 4 | 26 |
| web | 104 | 22.0 | 12 | 24 |
| multi | 101 | 74.9 | 36 | 46 |
| multi | 102 | 112.7 | 26 | 100 |
| multi | 103 | 122.5 | 17 | 114 |
| multi | 104 | 93.4 | 35 | 91 |
| batch | 101 | 108.0 | 24 | 67 |
| batch | 102 | 56.8 | 7 | 33 |
| batch | 103 | 66.9 | 12 | 44 |
| batch | 104 | 93.4 | 15 | 58 |
| gpu | 101 | 66.4 | 12 | 28 |
| gpu | 102 | 57.5 | 16 | 36 |
| gpu | 103 | 51.5 | 19 | 30 |
| gpu | 104 | 57.0 | 20 | 26 |

In 15 of 16 scenarios even a perfect controller needs more starts+stops than the laziest platform to reach the tightest platform's machine-hours. Those two platforms sit at opposite ends of one physical trade; beating both at once is impossible for any software. In C, a loss on one side of that pair is the price of a win on the other.

#### 6.3 Letting the equations drive directly

A governor in which the equations run closed-loop and their own quantities (control effort, unmet need I_U, the bath's rate) drive every muscle (`omnicompass/mathdrive.py`) was tested on 96 settings per workload: 66 losing cells, the same trade-off as the rule-based wiring. The engine clock alone moved batch p99 from 3.9 s to 0.1 s at equal energy.

#### 6.4 Strict C: the manuscript's closure law drives the machines and the pods

`omnicompass/closure.py` implements, as the only authority over machines, the laws of the owner's manuscript: the forward projection of Section 5c, the master closure law of Chapter 20 (F = G0 + Gc: no correction inside the admissible domain, an inward correction sized to restore the margin when the projected state approaches its boundary, so that G . n <= 0 on the boundary), the turning point of Chapters 29-30 (a machine is released only after the peak) and the dual-bath exchange of Chapter 31 (level and rate of demand). A release must also stay inside the calm set for a dwell (the resource-aware envelope, Proposition 2). Kubernetes' HPA and node managers are off; Kubernetes only schedules. Settings chosen on development scenarios, frozen by SHA-256 (56be5f50b8d2631c), then run once on 30 held-out scenarios per workload.

### 6A. Runtime Benchmark Protocol: faults at five stress levels

The owner's *OmniCompass Runtime Benchmark Protocol* (stage 1, Python runtime) run on this fleet plant with every architecture: 100 runs per stress level per workload, seeds 900001-900100 (never used for tuning). Level L injects L faults (machines dying, load spikes, services crash-looping, a noisy neighbour), identical for every system (`tools/protocol_bench.py`). A run is **conveyed** when every fault is recovered within 20 minutes and every cluster is inside the admissible basin for the final 10 minutes (worst response <= 1 s, queue < 0.28, pending pods <= 5%, power and heat inside limits). A **page** is an out-of-basin episode of 5 minutes or more, the usual alert rule: each would call a human. Nobody intervenes in the simulation.

### 6B. Second generation (held-out, settings frozen by SHA-256 before each run)

**B with muscle tone and consolidation** (`tuning/b_tone.py`, held-out seeds 700401-700430): machines a platform powers off are parked instead (alive, low power, instant wake), with a reserve sized by the law; Omni consolidates on top only where that loses nothing. Losing cells: 3 of 364.

**B fix for the remaining pairs** (`tuning/b_fix.py`, 30 development seeds, held-out 700701-700730): multi on aks_nap: 0 losing cells; batch on turbonomic: 0 losing cells; multi on cast_ai: 0 losing cells.

**Whole body at four-cluster sites** (`tuning/site_league.py`, held-out 701001-701030): traffic shift between a site's clusters (a cluster short of room runs its overflow on another cluster's powered spare cores, +5 ms per shifted request; assumes replicated services) and, for C, the closure law on the site total with one warm reserve.

| Platform | B losing cells | C losing cells | C energy | C slowest responses | C average |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Kubernetes | 0 | 2 | +16% | +56% | +30% |
| OpenShift | 0 | 2 | +19% | +46% | +29% |

| CAST AI | 0 | 0 | -0% | +94% | +42% |
| Spot Ocean | 0 | 0 | +2% | +91% | +40% |

C gains are Omni against that platform (positive = Omni better).

### 6C. Live levers on real Kubernetes (measured)

```
Live levers on real Kubernetes (kind, 1 control plane + 6 workers), GitHub Actions run 36270589830, commit 43f6747,
2026-09-26 20:45-20:48 UTC. Omni-Compass ran as its least-privilege service account (deploy/kind/rbac-omni.yaml +
rbac-levers.yaml). Script: scripts/kind_levers.sh. Result: LIVE LEVERS: PASS, 19 of 19 checks, 0 lever errors.

Permission receipts (kubectl auth can-i as the Omni service account)
  can:    patch pods/resize default, patch deployment/idle-worker, patch deployments/scale idle-worker,
          get configmap/omni-work, patch jobs default, create/delete resourcequotas agents, patch pods/resize agents
  cannot: delete pods agents, create pods agents, delete deployments agents, patch deployment/load-generator,
          create resourcequotas default, get secrets (any namespace)

rightsize   php-apache CPU requests: before [200m] after [50m]; after kill [200m]
coldstart   idle-worker replicas: idle -> 0; work waiting -> 2; idle again -> 0; after kill -> 2
batch_pace  train-a suspended: stress -> true; calm -> false; stress -> true; after kill -> false
contain     agent quota present: over budget -> 1; under budget -> 0; over -> 1; after kill -> 0
            agent CPU limits: before [400m 400m] contained [100m 100m] lifted [400m 400m] after kill [400m 400m]
cooling     setpoints written to the stand-in building controller: 27.0 27.0 27.0 22.0 (kill restores 22.0)
records left after kill: none

Earlier runs of the same script (kept for the record): run 36268772674 failed (containment could not lift: Kubernetes
refuses to raise a pod limit above a standing quota; one failing lever stopped the kill switch); run 36269885518 printed
PASS but its checks were chained so failures were not counted (containment still not lifted); run 36270202629 failed in
the script's quota probe once the quota was correctly deleted. Fixes: quota deleted before limits are restored; each
lever and each kill-switch restore isolated; every check counted on its own line.
Not covered: the cooling lever writes to a stand-in controller (a CI runner has no chiller); CPU frequency and power caps
need hardware with cpufreq; traffic shift needs two real clusters behind one load balancer.
```

### 7. Live Kubernetes (measured)

Two identical kind clusters (1 control plane + 6 workers) at the same time, same load; one with Omni-Compass on top (B). Omni runs as a least-privilege service account whose permissions are proven with `kubectl auth can-i` receipts before each run.

| Run | Change | Validity | p95 (ms) | p99 (ms) | Energy |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| 36221702999 | probe tunnel restarts on both arms; power cap able to apply | VALID | 491 to 383 | 613 to 491 | 224 to 216 |

Run 6 in full:

| Gauge | Kubernetes alone | + Omni-Compass | Change |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Worker nodes in service, mean | 6.00 | 3.19 | -46.8% |
| Node-hours | 2.02 | 1.07 | -47.0% |
| Energy (Wh), standby counted | 224 | 216 | -3.2% |
| Power (W), peak | 710 | 682 | -3.8% |
| Energy per core-hour (Wh) | 742 | 1,041 | +40.2% worse (significant) |
| Utilisation | 0.074 | 0.097 | +30.2% |
| Pending pods, pod-minutes | 0.283 | 0.533 | +88% (n.s.) |
| HPA shortfall, minutes | 0.817 | 1.33 | +63% (n.s.) |
| Response time (ms), mean | 264 | 165 | -37.4% |
| Response time (ms), median | 227 | 119 | -47.4% |
| Response time (ms), 95th percentile | 491 | 383 | -22.1% |
| Response time (ms), 99th percentile | 613 | 491 | -19.9% |
| Failed requests (%) | 0 | 0 | 0 |

First fully valid run with every live muscle on: fewer servers (-47%), less energy (-3.2%, standby counted), lower peak power, and faster responses at every percentile. The one significant negative is energy per core-hour (+48%): the power cap lowers the CPU the app consumes (-31%), and that CPU is the metric's denominator. Whether energy per request served also rose is not measured (the load generator's request count is not captured); a per-request energy gauge is added to the capture next.

### 8. The nine problem-map muscles (simulated, held-out, Omni-Compass direct against the strongest native tool)

| vmenergy | ratio | attr error pct -37%; worst vm error pct -34% | - |

### 9. Threats to validity

- Competitors are emulated from documentation on a shared plant; their production binaries may behave differently, and their full products include features (spot pricing, instance-type selection, rebalancing) that this plant does not model.
- Simulated plants are fluid models: pods pack perfectly, boot delay is fixed, power is idle + dynamic x utilisation. Real clusters fragment and boot times vary.
- Live runs use kind: nodes are containers on one CI machine; power is modelled, not metered; the two arms ran on two different CI machines. Six 20-minute runs are evidence of behaviour, not of production savings.
- Development and held-out scenarios come from the same generator; held-out protects against tuning to seeds, not against a generator that differs from real traffic. Real traces (PlanetLab) are covered in the main benchmark report.
- The loss rule uses a 0.5% tolerance and a 95% interval on 30 scenarios; small true differences can be missed.

## 51. Comparison with Existing Controllers



People who run these systems often see "autoscaling" everywhere and assume it all does the same thing. It does not.
This page sets out, from public descriptions, what each system controls, and where Omni-Compass sits among them.

**How to read it.** Borg and Twine are private to Google and Meta; Turbonomic is closed commercial software. None of
them can be run here, so they are compared by what their makers have published (papers, documentation, product
pages), never by a run. A mark of "—" means the capability is not in the system's public description, not that it
is impossible for it. The only fair measured comparison is on the customer's own system: their stack as it runs today
against the same stack with Omni-Compass on top, in paired runs (`docs/INTEGRATION_MANUAL.md`, section 6).

### 2. How each one decides

| | Typical rule | Omni-Compass |
|---|---|---|
| Pods | add replicas when average CPU passes a target | the same autoscaler keeps working; Omni-Compass sets its target from the whole system's state and raises floors ahead of bursts |
| Machines | add when pods cannot be placed, remove when underused | park and wake machines by one law, and only when every sense is live, pods are not rising and nothing waits |
| GPU | vendor default: full power, or a fixed cap set by hand | a cap from the engine, bounded by a floor and released at once when the card is busy or response time slips |
| CPU | the kernel's governor picks a clock from recent load | a ceiling from the same engine, inside the nervous system's envelope |
| Power | a fixed plan leaving room for every device at peak; a breaker or capper reacts when the site goes over | one conserved budget: watts move from organs holding surplus to organs in need, never created, never over the budget |
| Safety | per tool | one OFF switch returns every organ to its recorded setting; watch mode first; service first |

### 3. What is different, in plain words

1. **One brain instead of many separate reflexes.** Today each tool watches its own gauge: the pod autoscaler watches
   CPU, the node autoscaler watches pending pods, the GPU runs at its default, the power plan is fixed on paper.
   Nobody decides for the whole. Omni-Compass reads the whole system into one state and tells each tool the envelope
   it may act in. The tools keep doing their own jobs.
2. **Power as a budget that moves.** Today a building keeps room for every device to hit its peak at once, so much of
   its power sits reserved and unused. Omni-Compass treats the building's watts as one conserved total and moves them
   to where the work is: from CPUs and quiet GPUs to busy GPUs, never over the limit (`docs/CONVEYANCE_LAW.md`).
3. **A proof, not a tuned dial.** The budget law is proved to conserve the budget and to converge, and those
   properties are checked on every build (`tests/test_conveyance.py`).
4. **Service guarded on every power move.** Power is only taken back while response time is inside the target, and
   given back at once when it is not.
5. **Reversible in one move.** Every setting is recorded before it is changed and restored by one switch.

### 4. What the numbers show today, and what kind they are

| Against | Result | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| Kubernetes as it runs by default (HPA + fixed nodes) | p95 response time −37% to −55%, replicas −12% to −25%, machines in service −17% to −21% | measured on real Kubernetes (kind), 10 paired runs each, `results/live/` |
| A GPU at its vendor default | +1.3% to +5.1% work per energy, p95 within +10% | modelled card (MLPerf-calibrated), `results/gpu/sim/after` |
| Today's power practice (every GPU at one fixed cap that leaves room for every CPU at peak) | +1.4% to +5.7% work served, backlog −16% to −28%, never over the site budget | modelled, `results/hardware/NODE_EXCHANGE_*.json` |
| A reactive site capper alone | 60-196 minutes over the site budget without Omni-Compass; 0 with it | modelled |

Turbonomic, Borg and Twine cannot be measured here. Against a customer who runs one of them, the comparison is made on
the customer's own system, with the same paired method.

## 52. The State of Play



Current facts only. Earlier states, failures and chronology are kept whole in `docs/HISTORY.md`. The release this page
describes is identified by `RELEASE_MANIFEST.json` (commit, fingerprints of the engine, the C++ twins, the GPU protocol,
the live evidence and the verification receipt), which `verify.py` checks against the files.

**Rerun everything:** `pip install -r requirements.txt && python verify.py` ends with `VERIFICATION: PASS`.


### In one paragraph (2026-10-07, Omni v3)

**The engine is Omni v3, frozen and fingerprinted** (`OMNI_V3.json`, `docs/OMNI_V3.md`: v1's law and controllers byte
for byte, 945 muscles in 59 families, a do-no-harm gate on speed knobs). Every benchmark runs three times as separate
GitHub runs on it (A the result, B and C the replications) and every judged row reads confirmed better, confirmed worse,
no difference beyond the noise, or the runs disagree (`docs/OMNI_V1.md`, the rule). **Real Kubernetes, six tests, ten
pairs each, all six confirmed on v3** (`results/live/V3_*.md`): work inside the response line **+35% to +49%** in all
three runs of the all-four test (21.0 → 31.2 requests a second in run A); the 95th percentile **−47% to −66%** in every
run of the steady, wandering, all-four and fault tests; failed requests −9% to −14% where load swings; machines −1.5% to
−2.9% at steady load and −19% to −23% on the batch queue, with the standby-model energy −13% to −16% there; beside a
noisy neighbour no difference beyond the noise on every row. **A real database** (PostgreSQL behind PgBouncer,
`results/live/V3_PGBENCH.md`): 61% to 72% fewer connections held open for the same work and latency on two of three
workloads, at a confirmed cost in the host's CPU seconds (+14% to +28%), counted against Omni. **Real messaging** (Apache
Kafka as shipped, `results/live/V3_KAFKA.md`): on all three untouched workloads work inside the 500 ms line **+16% to
+21%**, the 95th percentile 1.6 s → 9 to 14 ms and messages waiting −92% to −97%, confirmed better, no message lost;
consumers held 2 → 6 to 8, **confirmed worse**, the resource the gain costs; host CPU worse on one workload, inside the
noise on two. **A real cache** (Redis as shipped, `results/live/V3_REDIS.md`): on all three untouched workloads work inside
the 2 ms line **+14% to +27%**, the hit rate +14% to +27% and the mean latency −30% to −61%, confirmed better; the memory
ceiling held 64 → 200 to 270 MB, **confirmed worse**, the resource the gain costs; host CPU inside the noise. **The Omni
index, real machines only, confirmed three times: +30.2%** (`results/OMNI_INDEX.md`; Kubernetes +25.5%, the database
+14.2%, Kafka +166.9%, Redis −24.9%, each category weighed the same; a row inside the noise counts as exactly 1; Kafka's
speed ratio is large because native's queue grew at nine tenths of its capacity and Omni's did not; Redis's category is
negative because the memory it holds for a wide working set is the resource it trades and reads worse by rule). The v1
tables read the same and stay as the first engine's record.

**What is shown and what is not.** Shown: more work inside the response line on the same machines and a faster tail,
on real Kubernetes, three times on a frozen engine; a real database holding fewer connections for the same service; a
real message queue kept short at the cost of more consumers running.
Not yet shown: an energy or cloud-bill saving on real machines. Energy on kind is a declared model (the machines are
containers on one runner); Azure's bill on a 4-worker fleet read no difference beyond the noise on every gauge
(`results/live/V1_AKS_STEADY.md`, `V1_AKS_BURST.md`), which is a fleet too small to show one machine; the fleet of 40
workers in nine machine families that can show one is preregistered and dispatched (`docs/K8S_COMPASS_PREREGISTRATION.md`,
the fleet that can show one machine, amendments 1 to 3), waiting on Azure's own capacity in eastus. The real card has
not run on the current governor; every earlier card result is obsolete and is run again by the founder on rented cards.

### Measured on a real cloud (Azure, its own bill), Omni v1

| Test | Reading | Source |

| A burst sized to the cluster, 4 workers, 5 pairs | the bill +5.0% with its interval across zero; p99 −34% clear of the noise in this one run; the rest inside the noise | `results/live/V1_AKS_BURST.md` |
| The fleet that can show one machine (40 workers, nine families) on v3 | dispatched; two earlier dispatches refused by the subscription's family allowances before any arm ran, the third by Azure's own cluster capacity in eastus; every refusal cost cents and is recorded | `docs/K8S_COMPASS_PREREGISTRATION.md` |

### Simulated (evidence class S: models, never counted in the headline), Omni v3

| What | Reading | Source |
|---|---|---|
| The 945 muscles and six organisms, A/B/C | reproduced to the digit in 3 of 3; 0 muscles worse; every organism superior within guardrails (work per energy +0.1% to +0.3%) | `results/realms/REALMS.md` |
| The organisms at 1, 10, 100 and 1,000 copies × 1 to 1,000 runs, 84 of 90 cells | every organism superior within guardrails in every cell of 10 runs or more; work per energy +0.07% to +0.37%, the same figure at every size; the six cells left are beyond the machines available | `results/scale/GRID.md` |
| Power grid, 11 SimBench grids in pandapower, A/B/C (v1 and v3 identical) | with ZIP loads energy drawn and net import better in all 11; losses better in 7, worse in 4; tap operations fewer in 10, 4 → 8 a year in one (worse, the declared cost) | `results/live/V3_PANDAPOWER.md` |

| Drone swarms, gym-pybullet-drones, 20 drones in three cells, A/B/C | energy a mission −7% to −20% and missions a charge +8% to +25%, confirmed better; no late mission, reserve breach, near miss or collision in any arm | `results/live/V3_SWARM.md` |

### The card (evidence class P)

Every earlier card result ran on a controller since replaced and is obsolete. The one-card, card-inside-the-organisms
and eight-card runs are the founder's, on rented cards, after the CPU and cloud work, at one named commit
(`docs/GPU_RUN_GUIDE.md`, `docs/GPU_PREREGISTRATION.md`).

### Verified in code

| Property | Where |
|---|---|
| The canonical engine is `symmetric_verified`; the printed chart is a named variant, not benchmarked | `docs/CANONICAL_ENGINE.md` |
| Nine laws twinned in C++20 and proven equal to the Python; sealed by fingerprint | `results/SEAL.json`, `tools/seal.py` |
| The conveyance law conserves its budget and converges (proof and 20,000 random systems) | `docs/CONVEYANCE_LAW.md`, `tests/test_conveyance.py` |
| Safety shield: 2,000,000 adversarial cases, 0 violations; C++ engine: 100,000,000 decisions, no failures | `tests/test_shield_properties.py`, `results/SOAK.json` |


### Open

1. **Azure, the fleet that can show one machine**: steady and burst on 40 workers, v3; waiting on Azure's cluster
   capacity in eastus (the only region where this subscription has more than 10 cores). Then B and C.
2. **The four stacked and the tower at 1,000 copies with the real cluster inside, on v3**: the stack runs on a rented
   machine (10,800 s window, three repetitions, about 20 hours); the tower follows.
3. **The real card**: the founder's runs on Lambda, one exact commit.
4. **Robustness** (`docs/ROBUSTNESS_PREREGISTRATION.md`, built, no engine file changes): the governor killed outright
   mid-run and the watchdog's hand-back, the long run, and the governor's own CPU at 1 to 1,000 copies; the last is done
   from the archives (`results/live/V3_OWN_COST.md`: 0.006 to 0.013 of one core at every size); the first two run as A,
   B and C next.
5. **YCSB on MongoDB** (`docs/YCSB_PREREGISTRATION.md`, built): the operator's WiredTiger cache as native, Omni on the cache
   size through the server's own console; the smoke run first, then A, B and C on v3.
6. **The queue** (`docs/REGISTER.md` section 4, `docs/PROOF_PROGRAM.md`): drone swarms on PX4 and ArduPilot (gym-pybullet-drones done), YCSB on
   Cassandra and Redis and HammerDB, Spark, OpenSearch, fio, Open-RMF, the 24-hour robustness run, Basilisk, Orekit and GMAT,
   RocketPy, Cantera (Kafka and Redis done); one or two at a time, each preregistered.
7. **Omni-Compass 1.0**: when the founder declares the engine final, v3 as it stands is published as 1.0 and the older
   fingerprints go to `docs/history` as the road to it.

## 53. Where the Value Comes From


### 3.1 The problem we are attacking

Computing has run into a wall that is not made of silicon. Data centers cannot get the power they need, cannot get it
fast enough, and are running out of room to put more machines. AI made it worse: every new model needs more chips, and
every chip needs more electricity and more cooling. The answers on the table are expensive and slow: new chips that do
more work per watt (a new generation, new hardware to buy), new power plants and power contracts (billions, and years),
and point fixes at a single layer (an AI serving trick, a scheduler, a power cap on one chip).

We attack it from the other side. Every system already running wastes room it paid for:

- GPUs boost to the top of their clock range and are knocked back by their own power limiter many times a second;
- Kubernetes keeps replicas and machines sized for the worst minute of the day;
- cooling runs colder than the heat requires; batteries hold more reserve than the hour needs.

That room is paid for in energy, in machines and in floor space, and it produces nothing.

### 3.2 What Omni-Compass is, in one paragraph

Omni-Compass is software that sits **on top of** the controllers a system already has (the GPU's firmware, the
Kubernetes autoscaler, the building's thermostats) and governs every layer under one law: a bounded push and pull that
keeps each service in the middle of its band instead of far below its limit. It never replaces the native controller,
never asks for more than the native settings allow, hands every knob back the moment it is switched off or loses a
sense, and refuses any step that measures more than 2% worse on anything. No new hardware. It stacks on top of every
other fix a data center makes.

### 3.3 The benefit: more work from what is already paid for

The room that was spent on nothing becomes one of two things, and a company chooses which:

- **More work for the same cost:** the same machines and the same watts carry more work; or
- **The same work for less:** fewer machines in service, fewer watts, a smaller bill.

They are the same gain read from two sides (3.4). The health side comes with it: faster answers, faster recovery from
failures, nothing waiting, every knob returned, no human babysitting the stack.

### 3.4 How to read the benefit: the arithmetic

Every comparison is paired: the same system, the same work, the same moments, native alone against native with
Omni-Compass on top. Let

- *W* be the work served (requests answered, tokens generated), held equal in both arms;
- *C* be a resource it used: machine-hours, CPU core-hours, or joules.

**Productivity** is work per resource, *P = W / C*. With the work held equal, the gain from Omni-Compass on top is

  *G = P_omni / P_native − 1 = C_native / C_omni − 1.*

A gain *G* means the same resources can carry *G* more work. Read from the other side, the same work needs only

  *C_omni / C_native = 1 / (1 + G)*

of the resources, a saving of *S = G / (1 + G)*. So **a third more work (G = 33%) is a quarter off the bill
(S = 25%)**; 20% more work is 16.7% off; 50% more work is a third off. Both columns are the same measurement.

Three rules for reading any receipt:

1. **The work must be equal.** Every receipt states that the load was fixed-rate (open loop): the same requests at the
   same moments in every arm. Without that, a lower resource count could just mean less work was done.
2. **Nothing may be worse.** Beside every gain the receipt prints response times, failures, waiting and the controller's
   own CPU, each with its 95% interval. Our one rule (`DISCLOSURES.md`, section 3): no measure more than 2% worse, and
   only where energy or the bill is saved. A gain paid for with worse service is not a gain.
3. **Know the class and the comparator.** A machine-hour gain on kind (where idle machines stay powered and native has
   no node autoscaler) is not yet a bill; a modelled energy line is not a meter. Section 14 lists the classes; section 16
   says, for every result, what it is measured against.

**Three worked examples, from the tables.** In the all-four Kubernetes test on v3, the same ten machines carried 35% to
49% more requests inside the response line: *G* is 0.35 to 0.49, so the same work would need 1/1.35 to 1/1.49 of the
machines, a saving *S* of 26% to 33%, had the fleet been free to shrink; on kind it was not, which is why the table
reports the work column and not a bill. In the database test, the pooler held 61% to 72% fewer connections open for the
same work: the resource there is connections, *C_omni / C_native* is 0.28 to 0.39, and the gain read as "more work for
the same connections" would be *G* = 1.6 to 2.6, which the table reports as the machines-equivalent column, "fewer
connections by". In the Kafka test the work inside the line rose 16% to 21% while the consumers running rose by a factor
of 2.6 to 4: there the gain in work was bought with resources, and the table reports both, the one as confirmed better
and the other as confirmed worse, because that is what happened.

### 3.5 Where the evidence stands today, read honestly

Every number below is from a three-run table on the frozen engine Omni v3, with its evidence class and the question a
referee is entitled to ask about it. The answers to those questions are given, where they exist, in the row; where they
do not yet exist, the row says what will supply them.

| What | Measured, same work, three runs | Class | What a referee will ask, and the answer |
|---|---|---|---|
| Kubernetes: work inside the response line, all four in one run | **+35% to +49%** confirmed better | L | "Is the cluster real?" Kubernetes is real (API server, scheduler, HPA); the seven nodes are containers on one 4-core GitHub runner, so the host's own busy share is recorded beside every run and the machines column is machine-hours in service, not a bill. The bill is Azure's test (below) |
| Kubernetes: 95th-percentile response time, steady, wandering, all four, faults | **47% to 66% faster** confirmed better | L | "Did native have a fair chance?" Native is Kubernetes with its HPA at the operator's target of 50%; the cost-to-match runs on the earlier engine showed no native target tried (40, 30, 20) reached Omni's p95 (`docs/history/`). The runs are paired on one runner with the order rotated |
| Kubernetes: machines in service | −1.5% to −2.9% at steady load, **−19% to −23%** on the batch queue, confirmed better; inside the noise on the other tests | L | "Why so little?" Because the verdict kept every machine whose removal made requests slower in the paired trial. Earlier engines without that check parked 29% to 36% of the machines and paid for it in response time; the frozen engine puts service first. kind has no node autoscaler, so parked machines stay powered: the saving is machine-hours, not watts |
| Kubernetes: energy | the standby model, −13% to −16% on the batch queue, inside the noise elsewhere | L, modelled | "Is it a meter?" No. The machines are containers; energy is a declared formula (a parked worker at 25 W standby), stated as a model on every line |
| Kubernetes: fairness beside a noisy neighbour | no difference beyond the noise on every row, the neighbour's included | L | "Does it hurt the other tenant?" Not measurably, in three runs of ten pairs |
| Database behind its pooler: connections held open | **−61% to −72%** confirmed better on two workloads; the runs disagree on the third | L | "What did it cost?" Host CPU-seconds +14% to +28%, confirmed worse on all three workloads, the compass's own cost included, counted against Omni in the index; work and latency inside the noise |
| Message broker: work inside the 500 ms line; the 95th percentile | **+16% to +21%**; 1.6 s → 9 to 14 ms, confirmed better on all three workloads; no message lost | L | "Why is the latency figure so large?" By design native sat at nine tenths of its measured capacity, so its queue grew at the high steps and Omni's did not; the gain is the queue kept short. "What did it cost?" Consumers running 2 → 5.8 to 7.9, confirmed worse; host CPU worse on one workload, inside the noise on two |
| Cache: work inside the 2 ms line; the hit rate | **+14% to +27%** and +14% to +27%, confirmed better on all three workloads; no failed request | L | "What did it cost?" The memory ceiling held, 64 → 200 to 270 MB, confirmed worse, and the memory used with it; host CPU inside the noise. "Why is p95 unchanged?" A miss costs the declared 5 ms trip in both arms and 5% of requests still miss at the high notches; the gain is in the mean and in the work inside the line. "Why is the cache's index negative?" Because its resource column is the memory held, a ratio of about 0.25, and the geometric mean of a 1.2 gain and a 0.25 cost is below one |
| The modelled realms: work per energy, 945 muscles, six organisms, 1 to 1,000 copies | **+0.07% to +0.37%**, every organism superior within guardrails, 0 muscles worse | S | "Why so small?" The native controllers in the models are well tuned and leave little room; the number is small and real within the model, the same at every size, and it is never counted in the headline |
| Power grid, 11 SimBench grids in pandapower | energy drawn and net import better in all 11; losses better in 7, **worse in 4**; tap operations fewer in 10, 4 → 8 a year in one, worse | S | "Where does it lose?" In the rural and semi-urban grids with their own generation, where a lower voltage raises losses; the table shows it |
| Robot arms, MuJoCo Menagerie | peak torque −29% and −10%, tracking error −21% where Omni moved; the Panda's copper loss **+14% worse**; two arms left native | S | "What about the arms that gained nothing?" The paired physics trial left them native and the table says "nothing for Omni to move" |
| Buildings with batteries, CityLearn, 11 districts | electricity bought, daily peak and unevenness better in all 11; the bill **worse in 7**; ramping worse in 7 | S | "Is the bill a loss?" Yes, in the 2023 districts, and it is in the table as such |
| Drone swarms, gym-pybullet-drones, three 20-drone cells | energy a mission −7% to −20%, missions a charge +8% to +25%; no late mission, reserve breach, near miss or collision | S | "Is the energy a meter?" No, a declared model from the simulator's own motor constants; the tracking error rose from 0.07 to 0.13 m inside its 0.25 m band and is shown |
| The governor's own cost, 1 to 1,000 copies with the real cluster inside | **0.006 to 0.013 of one core** at every size, 0.1% to 0.3% of the host's cores | L | "Does the brain's cost grow with the body?" No: it governs the real cluster, and that cost does not grow with the organism around it; shown, not judged, each run under its own engine (`results/live/V3_OWN_COST.md`) |
| The governor killed outright mid-run (the smoke run; A, B and C running) | every setting back at the operator's **7 s** after the kill in the one smoke repetition; the counted runs decide | L | "What if Omni-Compass dies?" The watchdog hands back from the lease the governor left; the preregistered allowance is 60 s and the three counted runs read against it |
| Azure's bill on a 4-worker fleet (v1) | no difference beyond the noise on any gauge | L, a real bill | "Then where is the saving?" A fleet of 4 cannot show one machine; the 40-worker fleet that can is preregistered and waits on Azure's own cluster capacity in its region |
| The real card (GPU) | **obsolete**: every earlier card result ran on a controller since replaced | P pending | "When?" The founder's runs on rented cards at one named commit, after the CPU and cloud work |

The upside the real-software data points toward is a third to a half more work from what is already installed on the
Kubernetes side, with faster answers, and a smaller, resource-priced gain on the stacks where the knob is a pool, a
consumer group or a ceiling. It becomes a claim about the bill, not a direction, when two tests land: the bill on a real
cloud with a fleet big enough to show one machine, and the real card's own meter. We publish each of them as it comes,
whatever it says.

### 3.6 One law, frozen; and what came before it

The engine in every result of this manual is **the compass law with the verdict** (sections 6 and 1.2), frozen as Omni
v1 on 5 October 2026, grown to the 945-muscle catalog as v2 and given the slack gate on speed knobs as v3, with the law,
the controllers and the runners the same bytes in all three (`docs/OMNI_V1.md`, `OMNI_V2.md`, `OMNI_V3.md`). Earlier
engines, among them an allocation law that gave back about a third of the machines at the cost of response time and a
compass law without the verdict, produced the numbered sets kept in `docs/history/`; their results are history, labelled
as the engine that produced them, and are never read beside v1's or v3's. A buyer does not choose between modes: there is
one law, and it is the one every table in Part VI was made on. Each new result therefore describes exactly the code that
produced the old ones, and when the founder declares the engine final, the engine that stands then is published as
Omni-Compass 1.0, with the older fingerprints kept as the road to it, never as a second product.

## 54. The Economics of a Receipt


Run the stack native and print the receipt. Run the same stack with Omni-Compass and print the receipt. The difference
is the gain, read from either side: more work for the same energy, or the same work for less energy and fewer machines.

The license fee is set against the measured gain on the customer's own receipt. On a stack that costs one hundred, a
measured gain of ten is worth ten; the fee is a share of that ten, and the customer keeps the rest. Percentages from
different parts of a stack are not added into one bill: the invoice is one gain, measured once.

The value a customer sees comes in three forms, each on its own line of the receipt:

1. **Work per energy** - more finished work per kilowatt-hour.
2. **Capacity** - the same work on fewer machines in service; it becomes a cost reduction when the released machines are
   returned to the cloud or switched off by the platform around Omni-Compass.
3. **Service** - faster responses and fewer breaches at the same load.

The babysitting tax - the people and tools kept on the clock to set caps, answer pages and turn knobs back after a run
or a crash - is the cost Omni-Compass removes by holding the knobs and returning them itself.

**The receipt's arithmetic, and the one number.** With the work held equal, a gain G in productivity is the same
measurement as a saving S = G / (1 + G) in resources: a third more work is a quarter off the bill (manual, section 3.4).
Across every real stack the one number is the Omni index (`results/OMNI_INDEX.md`): each test's work, speed, machines and
energy as ratios, combined by geometric means so that a gain and an equal loss cancel exactly, each real category weighed
the same, and only rows confirmed in three separate runs counted. The index is honest in both directions by construction.
As this edition is written it reads +30.2%: real Kubernetes +25.5%, the database +14.2%, messaging +166.9%, and the cache
−24.9%, the last negative because the memory the governor holds for a wide working set is the resource it trades and
reads worse by rule, even as the cache's work and hit rate read better. A buyer reads the category that matches their
stack, and reads its losses in the same table as its gains.

**What a receipt is not.** A receipt is not a forecast. It is the measured difference between two arms on one system at
one time, with its interval. The only number that applies to a customer's system is the one their own paired runs produce,
and the method of those runs is the manual's section 13, the same method every table in this book was made with.

## 55. The Buyer Edition



> **Superseded for live results.** The live evidence below predates sets 19 and 20. The current live table is `results/live/LIVE_PAIRED.md`; energy on kind is a declared model, not a meter. The first metered test is `scripts/gpu_paired.sh` (`docs/GPU_BENCH.md`).


Commit cdc8cd9. Every number below is generated from result files in the repository by `python tools/buyer_report.py`. Simulated results use the repository's fleet plant; live results come from real Kubernetes (kind) in GitHub Actions. Competitors are reproduced from their public documentation, not their binaries.

### What Omni-Compass is

- **The engine:** a six-state control engine, stable by construction (every mode decays), in Python and C++.
- **The law it applies:** the closure law of the owner's manuscript.
  - It does nothing in the safe interior.
  - It corrects inward when the forecast approaches capacity.
  - It releases a machine only after the peak.
  - It keeps released machines warm for instant reuse.
- **What it governs:** machines, pod counts and sizes, cold start, batch pacing, containment of runaway agent workloads, and cooling setpoints.
- **Two ways to deploy it:**
  - **B, on top of the platform a customer already runs.** Nothing is replaced.
  - **C, alone.** Kubernetes stays only as the muscle; the scaling layer is replaced (HPA, Cluster Autoscaler, Karpenter, and optimizers such as CAST AI, Spot Ocean and Turbonomic).

### B: Omni-Compass on top of each platform (held-out scenarios, settings frozen first)

### C: Omni-Compass alone, one global setting, confirmatory run

- **Setting:** one global setting for every workload, frozen by SHA-256 before the run (28cbb82607cb0009).
- **Scenarios:** 100 never-used scenarios per workload (seeds 710001-710100).
- **Comparisons:** 364 cells (4 workloads x 7 platforms x 13 gauges).
- **Rule:** a cell counts as better or worse only if it survives Holm-Bonferroni correction across all 364 cells (family alpha 0.05) and exceeds the 0.5% practical tolerance. Otherwise it is equal.

**Result:** 153 better, 174 equal, 37 worse.

| Workload | Better | Equal | Worse | The worse cells |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Web services | 41 | 41 | 9 | Kubernetes typical response (p95) 20.7%; Kubernetes machine starts+stops 24.5%; OpenShift typical response (p95) 20.8%; OpenShift machine starts+stops 66.0%; OpenShift scale reversals 152.0%; GKE typical response (p95) 20.1%; AKS NAP / Karpenter typical response (p95) 19.7%; CAST AI typical response (p95) 19.2%; Spot Ocean typical response (p95) 19.7% |
| Four clusters, one site | 45 | 36 | 10 | Kubernetes typical response (p95) 20.4%; Kubernetes machine starts+stops 23.7%; OpenShift typical response (p95) 20.5%; OpenShift machine starts+stops 62.1%; OpenShift scale reversals 207.3%; GKE typical response (p95) 19.7%; AKS NAP / Karpenter typical response (p95) 19.3%; Turbonomic typical response (p95) 27.6%; CAST AI typical response (p95) 18.8%; Spot Ocean typical response (p95) 19.3% |
| Batch jobs | 35 | 50 | 6 | Kubernetes machine starts+stops 39.0%; OpenShift machine starts+stops 29.5%; AKS NAP / Karpenter energy 2.1%; CAST AI energy 1.2%; Spot Ocean energy 2.2%; Spot Ocean machine-hours 0.6% |
| GPU training | 32 | 47 | 12 | AKS NAP / Karpenter energy 1.0%; AKS NAP / Karpenter time over power limit 1.6%; AKS NAP / Karpenter time over heat limit 1.1%; CAST AI energy 1.0%; CAST AI time over power limit 3.2%; CAST AI time over heat limit 2.6%; CAST AI time healthy 1.6%; Spot Ocean energy 1.2%; Spot Ocean time over power limit 3.8%; Spot Ocean time over heat limit 1.8%; Spot Ocean machine-hours 1.4%; Spot Ocean time healthy 2.0% |

| Workload | Energy vs Kubernetes | Machine-hours | Slowest responses | Average response |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Web services | +21% | +38% | +40% | +11% |
| Four clusters, one site | +25% | +40% | +41% | +13% |
| Batch jobs | +6% | +18% | +40% | +2% |
| GPU training | +2% | +11% | +0% | +0% |

Positive means Omni-Compass is better.

### Real demand: 1,052 recorded machines (PlanetLab)

- **Losing cells:** Omni-Compass alone, with the frozen web setting (never tuned on these traces), loses 0 of 91 against the seven platforms.
- **Whole-pod packing:** with whole-pod packing it loses 0 of 91.
- **Against Kubernetes:**
  - energy +24%
  - machine-hours +33%
  - typical response +97%
  - slowest responses +85%

Positive means better.

### Four-cluster sites as one body (held-out)

- **The mechanism:** traffic shift between clusters, plus the law run on the site total with one warm reserve.
- **Omni-Compass alone:** zero losing cells against GKE, AKS NAP / Karpenter, CAST AI, Spot Ocean.
- **Omni-Compass on top:** zero losing cells on all seven platforms.
- **Assumption:** services are replicated across the site's clusters.

### Under failure: the runtime protocol

Machines dying, load spikes, crash-looping services and noisy neighbours were injected at five stress levels, with identical faults for every system. Totals over all levels:

| Workload | System | Runs conveyed | Pages to a human | Recovery (min) |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Web services | CAST AI | 231 of 500 | 404 | 6.6 |
| Web services | Kubernetes | 218 of 500 | 338 | 8.3 |
| Web services | Omni-Compass alone | 240 of 500 | 246 | 5.1 |
| Four clusters, one site | CAST AI | 44 of 500 | 608 | 5.7 |
| Four clusters, one site | Kubernetes | 44 of 500 | 330 | 6.5 |
| Four clusters, one site | Omni-Compass alone | 46 of 500 | 197 | 3.6 |

### The supervisory nervous system

- **One state, every organ:** `omnicompass/nervous_system.py` turns the engine's state (convergence, basin health, stress against its equation-6 equilibrium, unmet need) into one calm value between 0 and 1.
- **Authority from calm:** calm grants each organ its authority:
  - pods and machines may give capacity back only above their reversibility thresholds (0.5 and 0.7);
  - CPU frequency, GPU power, routing and cooling get envelopes that widen with calm;
  - batch is admitted or paused;
  - rollback is authorised.
- **Holds and the shield:** a security hold stops every capacity organ from expanding. The shield stays downstream and can still veto.
- **Invariants tested:** 300,000 random engine states, with zero violations (`tests/test_nervous_system.py`).
- **Coordination:** pods move first, and a machine move opposite to the pod move is vetoed. Controller contradictions per day (fighting, or a reversal within one boot time):
  - web: 2.10 to 0.10;
  - four-cluster: 5.30 to 1.03, below Kubernetes' 2.10.

**Coordination, confirmatory on fresh seeds 712001-712100** (frozen first in `tuning/COORD_PREREGISTRATION.json`, same 364 cells, same Holm rule): 151 better, 173 equal, 40 worse.

| Workload | Better | Equal | Worse | Contradictions per day: Omni-Compass / Kubernetes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Web services | 40 | 41 | 10 | 0.07 / 0.52 |
| Four clusters, one site | 45 | 37 | 9 | 0.56 / 1.77 |
| Batch jobs | 35 | 49 | 7 | 0.11 / 0.00 |
| GPU training | 31 | 46 | 14 | 0.11 / 0.04 |

**Mechanism ablation** (`tuning/ABLATION.json`, fresh seeds 711001-711030): each part of the law removed in turn, against the full law. Listed: the gauges that get significantly worse (95% interval excludes 0, more than 0.5%).

| Part removed | Web services | Four clusters, one site | Batch jobs | GPU training |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| engine release gate removed | no change | no change | no change | no change |
| turning point removed | no change | machine starts+stops +2%, scale reversals +6% | slowest responses (p99) +32%, average response +12%, time over backlog limit +333%, machine starts+stops +47%, scale reversals +193%, contradictions +1350% | machine starts+stops +18%, scale reversals +118%, contradictions +1000% |

### Live Kubernetes evidence

Repeated live runs, 5 paired repetitions per arm, probe through the Service (`results/live/LIVE_REPS_3.md`):

## Live repetitions, set 3: GitHub Actions run 36289557446 (commit 9892270), 5 × native / omni / strict on kind

This is the first set with the probe through the Service (NodePort via kube-proxy) and the PodDisruptionBudget, and
the first live set with the supervisory nervous system gating machine release.

### C: Omni-Compass decides (strict) vs native, 5 paired repetitions

| Gauge | Native | Omni | Change | 95% interval of the difference | Significant |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| worker nodes in service, mean | 6 | 6 | +0.0% | -7.797e-16 to +7.797e-16 | no |
| node-hours | 1.517 | 1.518 | +0.0% | -0.00974 to +0.01041 | no |

### Reading

**Failed requests.** They are 0% in every arm. The 16-66% of sets 1-2 was the probe's hung tunnel, as diagnosed.

**Machines.** Omni-Compass kept all 6 machines in service in every repetition. Controller log: 15 of 15 decisions,
0 errors, no node-scale command.

- **The likely cause.** With a working probe, p95 sits at 430-460 ms against the 500 ms SLO declared before the run.
  Every window above 500 ms is SLO pressure. That pressure blocks machine release for the next 3 decisions and lowers
  the engine's calm.
- **Why that is odd here.** Machines are at 7% utilisation with no waiting pods. The latency comes from the
  workload's per-request compute, not from a machine shortage.
- **Why the earlier sets differed.** Sets 1-2 released machines because the hung probe produced few or no successful
  samples, so the controller saw little latency pressure. Their machine savings were therefore measured with a blinded
  latency sense and are not claimed.
- **How this will be settled.** The decision trail (p95, SLO state, calm, node authority per decision) is now printed
  in every job log. Set 4 will show which gate held.

**Everything else.** No significant difference from native on any gauge, except that C has more pending pod-minutes
(0.80 vs 0.34 pod-minutes).


- **Earlier live sets 1 and 2:** these carried a probe defect, now fixed. The probe's one-pod tunnel hung when a drain moved its pod, so the Omni arms logged false failed requests (`results/live/LIVE_REPS_PROBE_DEFECT.md`).
- **Their machine savings are withdrawn.** The hung probe left the controller's latency sense nearly blind, so it released machines it would not have released with a working probe. Set 3 shows that: with a working probe and latency near the declared 500 ms SLO, Omni-Compass kept all 6 machines. The decision trail per run is now in every job log (set 4).

**Live levers under the nervous system:**

- **What acted:** right-sizing, cold start, batch pacing, agent containment and the cooling connector.
- **Authority:** each lever acted on real Kubernetes only inside the authority the nervous system granted.
- **Kill switch:** it restored every lever, including from a fresh process.
- **Result:** 19 of 19 checks passed (`results/live/LIVE_LEVERS_2_NERVOUS.txt`, first pass `LIVE_LEVERS_1.txt`).
- **Identity:** least-privilege, with `kubectl auth can-i` receipts.

**Shadow pilot kit, live:** a read-only identity ran for 600 s and logged 40 decisions, with 0 writes (`results/live/LIVE_SHADOW_1.txt`). This is the kit a customer runs first.

### Safety and correctness

- **Safety shield:** tested on 2,000,000 random and adversarial inputs, with zero invariant violations, idempotent, never inventing an action, and intervening minimally (`tests/test_shield_properties.py`). The test found two real bugs, both fixed.
- **C++ twins:** the C++ shield and the C++ closure law match Python exactly, over 300,000 adversarial shield cases and every recorded closure decision.
- **Endurance:** the C++ engine ran 100,000,000 decisions with no failure, at about 2.3 microseconds per decision.
- **Fail-safe:** after repeated failed decisions, control returns to the native autoscalers.
- **Reproducibility:** a clean copy of the delivered zip reproduced every held-out result byte for byte.

### What is not claimed

- **No production or customer deployment yet.** The next step is the shadow pilot (`docs/PILOT_KIT.md`), which is read-only.
- **Live runs are small.** They use kind on CI machines, and power is modelled, not metered.
- **Hardware levers are not proven.** CPU-frequency and power caps need real servers, and cooling was exercised against a stand-in controller.
- **Parked machines in the public cloud.** A parked cloud machine still bills, so the warm-reserve energy saving applies to owned hardware.
- **Single-cluster energy against the tightest packers is roughly a tie.** There Omni-Compass wins on response time and stability.
- **Some gaps cannot be closed.** No controller, even one with perfect foresight, can match both the tightest packer's machine-hours and the calmest autoscaler's machine churn (`tuning/bound.py`).
- **Not modelled in the plant:** variable boot times and pod-eviction cost. Fragmentation is modelled (whole-pod packing) and is small.

## 56. Due Diligence



Answers reference the Claims Register (C-numbers) and the Technical Manual.

### Engineering
**Does the mathematics hold?** Equations (1) to (8), Propositions 1 to 3 and their proofs are in Manual Chapters 2 and 3. The 500/500 CONVEY/CERT result is a property of the controller (Proposition 3), shown by counterfactuals: the controller aimed at the wrong basin also scores 500/500.
**Is Python the same as C++?** Yes (C1, C2). The verifier also builds a deliberately mutated C++ governor and confirms the parity test rejects it.
**Can every number be reproduced?** `python verify.py` rebuilds the C++, reruns parity, reruns the 100,000,000-decision soak and compares it with the recorded result, replays held-out scenarios and checks the pre-registered SHA-256 hashes (program fingerprints are additionally checked when the Python version matches the recorded one).

### Operations
**Better than what we run today?** Compared against a documented-behaviour reference model of Kubernetes autoscaling (HPA tolerance 0.1, 300 s scale-down stabilization, HPA targets 0.5 to 0.8; simplified Cluster Autoscaler with 10-minute unneeded time, 0.5 utilization threshold, 10-minute delay after scale-up): C8 to C12, including where Omni-Compass is worse. The reference model is not the upstream controllers (C12b); running the upstream controllers against the same scenarios is the next baseline step.
**On real traffic?** Not yet. Results use a synthetic stack model. Replay of published production traces and the pilot protocol are the next evidence steps (C14).
**What happens when it is wrong?** Observe mode changes nothing (C6). The reset returns control to the native managers at the next interval (omni_kill arm). The shield blocks actions that violate I1 to I5 (C7).
**Will it wear hardware?** Machine start/stop cycles, power-cap travel and thermal travel are measured for every arm (C12, Manual Chapter 8).

### Security
**What authority does it hold?** Capacity, replicas, power caps, rollback authorization and routing, only in AUTOPILOT, only through the shield.
**Can it expand capacity during a security block?** No: invariant I1 is enforced before execution.
**Does it replace encryption, identity or policy engines?** No. Those components are retained (fleet model, security role).

### Finance
**What does it save?** Energy per run versus current autoscaling (C8). Fleet-scale figures are modeled (C13); the governance saving comes from reduced idle and padded capacity, not from removing the decision components' own consumption.
**What does it cost to run?** C5.

### Adoption
**How is it introduced without risk?** Observe, then shadow on production telemetry, then one control loop at a time under the reset (docs/PILOT_PROTOCOL.md).

### Referees
**Was it tuned on the test data?** No. Law, shield and baselines were frozen and fingerprinted before the held-out seeds 346410161 and 360555127 (results/PREREGISTRATION.json).
**Where does it fail?** Backlog violations against current autoscaling (C11); the engine-dynamics ablation (Manual Chapter 8); open obligations (Manual Chapter 10).

## 58. Licensing: Questions and Answers



Plain answers to the questions buyers, engineers and their lawyers ask. The binding terms are in `LICENSE`; where
this page and `LICENSE` differ, `LICENSE` governs. Every declaration is in `DISCLOSURES.md`.

**Is Omni-Compass open source?** No. The source is published so that it can be evaluated, reproduced and audited. It is
licensed under the Omni-Compass Evaluation License 1.0 (`LicenseRef-OmniCompass-Evaluation-1.0`), which permits
evaluation and simulation only.

**What may I do without a commercial license?** Read the code; run `verify.py`, the simulations and the benchmarks;
reproduce the published results; run Omni-Compass in watch or shadow mode, or in test, on systems you own or control,
for the purpose of evaluating it.

**What needs the Omni-Compass Enterprise License?** Any commercial use, commercialization or monetization; production
use; operating any system beyond evaluation; offering it as a hosted or managed service; redistributing it; or
incorporating it, or any part or derivative of it, into a product or service. The Enterprise License is a written
agreement signed by The Omni-Compass LLC and paid for.

**How is the Enterprise License priced?** Against the measured gain on the customer's own paired receipts (native
against Omni-Compass on the same system, the same load and the same clock). Terms are set in each signed agreement; no
price stated anywhere in this repository is an offer.

**Are patents involved?** Patent applications, copyright registrations and trademark applications covering the
Omni-Compass engine, its mathematics and its software have been filed in the United States by The Omni-Compass LLC
(`PATENTS.md`). The evaluation license grants no patent license beyond evaluation.

**May I use the name or the compass rose?** Only to refer to Omni-Compass accurately (`TRADEMARKS.md`).

**May I contribute?** Contributions require the contributor license agreement (`.github/CLA.md`).

**Does Omni-Compass send data anywhere?** No. The software contains no telemetry and makes no network connection of
its own except to the systems an operator points it at (a Kubernetes API, `nvidia-smi`, a meter command).

**What do scanners report?** The license is declared in machine-readable form for Black Duck, FOSSA, Snyk and REUSE
(`pyproject.toml`, `REUSE.toml`, `.fossa.yml`, `.snyk`, `sbom/`); third-party components are listed in
`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.

**Can the terms change?** Yes. The Omni-Compass LLC may change these terms, the software and every document at any
time; a signed Enterprise License governs its own term (`DISCLOSURES.md`, section 5).

**Who do I contact?** The Omni-Compass LLC, www.omni-compass.com.

## 61. Python, C++ and the Seal


The laws are twinned: each has a Python version and a C++20 version that give the same answers, proven by a parity
test on every build (`cmake -S cpp -B cpp/build && cmake --build cpp/build`).

| Law | Python | C++ | Proven by |
|---|---|---|---|
| core engine | `omnicompass/core.py` | `cpp/src/core.cpp` | 500 frozen fixtures |
| governor | `omnicompass/adapter.py` | `cpp/src/governor.cpp` | `tests/test_cpp_governor_parity.py` |
| safety shield | `omnicompass/shield.py` | `cpp/src/shield.cpp` | `tests/test_cpp_shield_parity.py` |
| HPA replica law | `fleet/harness.py` | `cpp/src/hpa.cpp` | `tests/test_cpp_hpa_parity.py` |
| closure law | `omnicompass/closure.py` | `cpp/src/closure.cpp` | `tests/test_cpp_closure_parity.py` |
| conveyance law | `omnicompass/conveyance.py` | `cpp/src/conveyance.cpp` | `tests/test_cpp_conveyance_parity.py` |
| nervous system | `omnicompass/nervous_system.py` | `cpp/src/nervous_system.cpp` | `tests/test_cpp_twins_parity.py` |
| compass and ledger | `omnicompass/compass.py`, `storage.py` | `cpp/src/compass.cpp` | `tests/test_cpp_twins_parity.py` |
| GPU governor rules | `omni_controller/gpu_governor.py` | `cpp/src/gpu_rules.cpp` | `tests/test_cpp_twins_parity.py` |

The seal (`results/SEAL.json`) holds the SHA-256 fingerprint of every twinned file, written only after every parity
test passes. `verify.py` fails, naming the file, if any sealed file changes afterwards. The compass law
(`omnicompass/compass_law.py`) and the two-wire GPU governor are in Python today; their C++ twins are next.

**Why two languages.** A law that exists in one implementation can hide a bug that is also its behaviour: the tests pass
because the tests were written against the same code. Two implementations written separately, in languages with
different numerics and different defaults, that agree to fifteen decimal places on five hundred trajectories and on every
fixture of the governor, the shield, the HPA law, the closure, the conveyance and the nervous system, are evidence that the
text of the law is what both compute. The C++ twin is also the one a buyer would embed where Python does not run (a
controller, a firmware, a PLC), and the soak (`results/SOAK.json`, one hundred million decisions, no failure) is run on
it. The seal makes the twins' agreement a property of the repository rather than a claim: change a sealed byte and
`verify.py` fails, naming the file.

**The three fingerprints.** The seal fingerprints the twinned laws; `OMNI_V1.json`, `OMNI_V2.json` and `OMNI_V3.json`
fingerprint the engine as a whole (law, controllers, muscles, runners: 38 to 40 files); `RELEASE_MANIFEST.json`
fingerprints the release (the commit, the engine, the twins, the GPU protocol, the live evidence and the verification
receipt) and is rewritten by `tools/release_manifest.py` before every push, under the Python GitHub runs. A reader holding
any one of the three can tell whether the files in front of them are the files the results were made on.

## 62. The Founder's Working Notes



Where a sentence is a design aim rather than what the code does today, or a figure that is not yet measured, the
check column says so. Nothing in this chapter adds a result: every number that is a result names the file it comes
from.

### What Omni is

OmniCompass is the governor. It is the process running on the processor, and the chip executes it. The card, the
replica count, the rack cap, the joint and the feeder are the levers: the muscles. Omni reads the meters, steps a
bounded loop, and writes only the lever it is allowed to write. When it stops, it puts that lever back.

It is not the chip, not the card and not Kubernetes. It is the brain on the host, writing through a bolt.

*Governor* is the machine word. A governor on a steam engine did not build the engine and did not turn the shaft. It
watched the speed and moved the throttle so the speed stayed in a band. The plant does the work: the chip, the card,
the pods, the job. Omni reads a meter, writes one lever, and puts that lever back.

### The loop

| The chapter says | The code today | Check |
|---|---|---|
| Omni reads the plant's meters and maps them to the state E, U, S | `omnicompass/adapter.py`, `observe_vector` and `assimilate` | matches |
| It computes the drift with the command at zero, then raw = −drift + K_P·(σ − U), clipped to the authority before the step | `omnicompass/core.py`, `control_command`: `u = clip(−f_U(x,t) + KP·(σ − U), ±U_AUTHORITY)` | matches |
| It holds that same u through every RK4 stage and does not rewrite U afterwards | `core.py`, `macro_step`: one `u` per micro step, passed unchanged into all four RK4 stages; U is never overwritten | matches (proved: `docs/TRACKING_THEOREM.md`) |
| It writes the clipped command u to the lever | **Not today.** The frozen live governor runs the engine with u = 0 (`macro_step(..., target=None)`) and uses u only as its convergence signal (`push = u / U_AUTHORITY`). The lever is set by the allocation law and the nervous system's authority (`omnicompass/nervous_system.py`). | **design aim**, see "What to strengthen" |
| On exit it restores the lever | kill switch: `omni_controller/controller.py` restore; the GPU bench restores and reads back the start limit; the realm harness checks every knob is handed back | matches |

So the step the chapter describes is the engine's own step, and it is proved. Writing u itself onto a lever, through
an output map with a gain in watts (or replicas) per unit of u, is a further mechanism. It is not what produced the
results below.

### Wiring

A wrist wire moves the wrist. It does not move a finger that has its own tendon unless that tendon is also wired.

The card's clock wire goes to the NVIDIA driver. The replica wire goes to the Kubernetes API. The scheduler's wire goes
to the kubelet. Those wires already exist and do not pass through Omni. Omni is an added process, and a tendon is
connected to it only if the output map writes that lever and the input map reads it back.

A power-limit write can make the driver drop clocks. That is a side effect on one finger, not the replica nerve, which
keeps running on its own path unless a second line is connected. The cluster starts its own wires: the API server
accepts a replica write, the scheduler places the pod, the kubelet starts it, the driver moves the clocks, and HPA, if
installed, is its own process. Omni joins those nerves. It is a client of the plant, not its origin.

### Four realms, five organisms

1. Compute / AI / Cloud: GPU server, Kubernetes, the card, the job.
2. Physics / Robotics / Autonomous: joint, servo, PLC, car, line.
3. Energy / Facility / Industrial: rack, cooling, PDU, battery.
4. Distribution / Specialized: network, feeder, logistics.
5. The whole organism: all 656 canonical muscles, each once, one clock.

A muscle may sit in more than one realm. Every realm stands on the same spine (Kubernetes, machines, GPUs and CPUs,
network, storage, observability, security, cooling, electrical distribution), and then has its own domain muscles. The
fifth run holds each of the 656 once.

Each organism is shown native, then with Omni, on the same membership, the same seed and the same clock: two receipts.
The core does not change when the lever changes.

| Check | |
|---|---|
| Built | `realms/` (round 3): spine of 190 muscles in all four realms; organisms of 345, 262, 282, 337 and 656 (`docs/REALM_MUSCLES.md`) |
| Result | Whole organism +0.1% work per energy, SUPERIOR WITHIN GUARDRAILS; the realms pay in service when they share the spine (`results/realms/REALMS.md`) |
| Limit | These are modelled plants (evidence S / rung E2). A catalog row is not a tendon. GitHub can host the compute organism for real (kind, and the GPU on a rented card); facility, machine and grid need their own hosts |
| Open | The 656 is a working catalog, not a census: `docs/realm_study/` checks it against the real systems' documentation and industry practice (waves 1 and 2 done; wave 3 maps every row) |

### Evidence rungs

| Rung (chapter) | Class (repository, `docs/EVIDENCE_LEDGER.md`) | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| E0 | design | the written spec |
| E1 | T / V | deterministic tests and proofs: Python against the C++ twin, the tracking theorem |
| E2 | S | simulation on a made plant (the realms, the fleet and GPU models) |
| E3 | L | real software: Kubernetes on kind, no card (sets 22 and 23) |
| E4 | P | a physical meter: the card's own power reading (the GPU bench; first run on an NVIDIA A10, 2026-10-02, `results/gpu/run-20261002T082232Z/GPU_REPS.md`; the corrected governor not yet run on a card) |

A result does not climb a rung by itself. The four realms are plants; E1 to E4 are how hard the proof is on whichever
plant is run.

### What blocked the card

The hash did not stop the card. A Python–C++ mismatch can fail a test after a machine has started the job; it cannot
stop GitHub from handing out a machine, because the runner is chosen before the code runs. The verify job started and
failed (fixed since: it is green), and separately the GPU job never got a machine.

The organisation's and enterprise's settings show no GPU runner and no option to create one (checked 2026-10-02), so no
budget could start it. The run therefore moves to a rented card (`scripts/gpu_rented_run.sh`, one command).

### The bake-off that exists

Set 23 (`results/live/LIVE_REPS_23.md`, run 36940088922): real Kubernetes, ten pairs, fifteen minutes an arm, the same
open-loop work, native against Omni, six kind workers, order rotated.

| Gauge | Native | Omni | Change |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Response, 95th percentile (ms) | 327.3 | 123.8 | −62.2% |
| Response, 99th percentile (ms) | 503.4 | 169.3 | −66.4% |
| Response, mean (ms) | 146.6 | 80.1 | −45.4% |
| Failed requests | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| HPA replicas, mean | 8.51 | 5.40 | −36.6% |
| Workers in service | 6 | 4.28 | −28.7% |
| Pods started | 4.7 | 1.7 | −63.8% |
| Pod start wait (s) | 18.6 | 3.8 | −79.6% |
| CPU, service plus Omni (cores) | 0.903 | 0.894 | −1.0% (no difference) |
| Energy, workers still on (Wh, declared model) | 159.0 | 158.7 | −0.2% (no difference) |

The same requests were sent and none failed. They were answered faster, on fewer copies, at the same bill. Kind
leaves every worker powered, so the watt line stays flat. Parking a worker and waking it again was tried; the churn ate
the saving (`docs/CLAIMS_REGISTER.md`, C17), so that path is closed on this plant.

Arithmetic, not a result: if a run finishes 5% more work, nineteen runs do what twenty used to (20 / 1.05 = 19.05).

### The chip

The card is the meter that can move the electric bill, and the meter that can move output.

Energy on the chip is the integral of power.draw. The same pile can be spent two ways:
- **Output:** more finished work on the same bill. The cap stays near where the native arm left it, the draw stays in
  the same band, and heat gets no new reason to rise.
- **The bill:** a lower enforced limit, the job still finishes, and joules fall.

A company short of cards spends it on output. A company paying for GPU hours with spare capacity spends it on the bill.
A company against a building power cap splits it. The bench's primary outcome, work per joule, counts both, and its
table prints requests and joules separately, so the receipt shows which way the pile went (`tools/gpu_reps.py`).

For the pile to be real:
- the cap has to bind;
- the write has to be enforced by the driver, and the enforced limit read back;
- the job has to finish;
- the limit has to be restored on exit, so the next native arm is not still capped.

All four are in the bench and its preregistration (`docs/GPU_PREREGISTRATION.md`, amendments 1–3).

### The babysitting tax

The electric bill is the small pile. The babysitting tax is the people and tools kept on the clock to watch the
levers, reset a cap, and stop the muscles fighting. A card's real cost is usually the card and the hours it sat idle or
late, not the electrons.

What fills the seat today is a person: someone sets the cap, someone gets the page when it is left down, someone turns
it back after the run or the crash. The product takes that knob and that page.

### What we found nobody selling

We found no published product that does all of the following across compute, machines, facility and grid as one
governor:
- reads all of their meters into one state;
- holds one clipped command through the step;
- puts each lever back when the run stops, and prints both receipts.

Borg, Twine and OpenShift govern compute. AWS is a cloud. Turbonomic covers the IT stack. Tesla runs the car, the
battery and the factory as separate software. Each covers more than one thing as a company, not four realms as one
governor.

Omni on such a stack does not replace it: Borg remains the muscle. This is a market observation from public material,
not a claim tested here.

### The bill

Run the stack native and print the receipt. Run the same stack with Omni and print the receipt. The difference is the
pile, and the fee is 20 percent of it.

On a stack that costs $100, a 10 percent win is $10. The fee is $2, and the customer keeps $8. In general, the fee is
0.2 × (measured win) × (spend). A gain and a cut are the same difference, read from opposite sides. Do not add CPU,
GPU and babysitting percentages into one bill: the invoice is one pile.

**Check:** the 10 percent is an example, not a measured win. What is measured so far:
- on Kubernetes, response time −62% at the same energy (set 23);
- in simulation, +0.1% work per energy for the whole organism (realm round 3);
- on a card, nothing yet: the GPU bench is the first real-meter number.

Revenue figures should be computed from the measured win on each customer's own receipt. The per-company table in the
working draft (2% of each company's published infrastructure spend) assumed a 10% win everywhere, and several of its
spend figures do not match the companies' published capital expenditure. It is left out of the repository until both
are sourced.

### What to strengthen

1. **Wire the output map.** u becomes one lever, read back and restored, with the start value, the written value and
   the value after a kill printed on the receipt. The GPU bench already records the start limit, every write and its
   read-back, and the restored limit. A u-to-lever output map (a gain in watts or replicas per unit of u) is a new
   mechanism. It would be preregistered and tested as its own arm, first in the realms, then on a card, never mixed
   into the frozen confirmation run.
2. **Keep the step as it is:** clip before the stage, hold u through RK4, do not rewrite U (proved:
   `docs/TRACKING_THEOREM.md`).
3. **Run native against Omni on the same membership for each realm.** Compute is the one GitHub can host for real;
   the other three are modelled until their hosts exist.
4. **Aim the chip at about 5% more finished work on the same bill**, cap unchanged and temperature no worse, or at
   fewer joules for the same work. The buyer chooses, and the receipt prints which.

## 63. History



Earlier states of play, kept whole. Nothing here is current status; the current state is `docs/STATE_OF_PLAY.md`.

### State of play as written on 27 September 2026 (with the update of 28 September)


> **Superseded for live results.** The live evidence below predates sets 19 and 20. The current live table is `results/live/LIVE_PAIRED.md`; energy on kind is a declared model, not a meter. The first metered test is `scripts/gpu_paired.sh` (`docs/GPU_BENCH.md`).


> **Update, 28 September 2026.** Added since this page was written, each with its evidence:
> - **Live, set 21** (conveyance only when response time needs it): p95 -37%, machines in service -21%, CPU used +26%
>   (unchanged from set 20; its source is still open). `results/live/LIVE_REPS_21.md`.
> - **GPU governor bounded** (0.70 share floor, busy gate, 2 s decisions): on the MLPerf-calibrated modelled card,
>   +5.1% and +1.3% work per kJ with p95 within +10% (the old governor failed that guardrail at +31% and +66%).
>   Model only. `results/gpu/sim/`.
> - **Speed lock** (opt-in): speed won elsewhere spent on GPU watts, every gauge kept at least 1% faster than
>   without Omni. Model only. `results/gpu/sim/pipeline/`.
> - **CPU and GPU on one conserved power budget** (conveyance law over CPU and GPU organs): +1.4% to +5.7% work
>   served against today's fixed caps, never over the site budget. Model only. `docs/CONVEYANCE_LAW.md`,
>   `results/hardware/NODE_EXCHANGE_*.json`.
> - **The manual in the box:** `docs/INTEGRATION_MANUAL.md`; every gauge: `docs/METRICS_CATALOG.md`; against what runs
>   today: `docs/COMPARISON.md`.

This is the whole repository at the commit named in `STATE_OF_PLAY_COMMIT.txt`. Everything below can be rerun from it.

**Run it live on real Kubernetes yourself:** on any machine with Docker, kind, kubectl and Python, run
`bash RUN_LIVE.sh 3`. It builds a fresh 7-node cluster per arm, runs native, Omni on top and Omni alone, and writes
`live_runs/LIVE_REPS.md`. GitHub Actions runs the same comparison with a pushed commit whose message contains `[reps]`.

**Rerun the whole thing:** `pip install -r requirements.txt && python verify.py`. It must end
`VERIFICATION: PASS`, and it does at this commit.

### Best measured results, and where each one comes from

| Claim | Evidence | Where |
|---|---|---|
| **B (Omni on top of each platform):** 0 losing cells on held-out scenarios; strictly better on 27 of 28 platform-workload pairs | simulation, pre-registered | `tuning/B_FIX.json`, `tuning/B_TONE_HELDOUT.json` |
| **Four-cluster sites:** B 0 losses on all 7 platforms; C 0 losses vs GKE, AKS/Karpenter, CAST AI, Spot | simulation, held-out | `tuning/SITE_LEAGUE.json` |
| **C (Omni alone), one global setting, 400 never-used scenarios:** 153 better / 174 equal / 37 worse of 364 cells (Holm-corrected) | simulation, confirmatory | `tuning/CONFIRMATORY.json` |
| **C with nervous-system coordination, 400 fresh scenarios:** 151 / 173 / 40 | simulation, confirmatory | `tuning/CONFIRMATORY_COORD.json` |
| **Controllers fighting each other:** lowest of all 8 systems on web (0.07 per day) and four-cluster sites (0.56 per day) | simulation, confirmatory | same file |
| **Real demand, 1,052 recorded PlanetLab machines:** 0 losing cells of 91 | simulation on real traces | `tuning/PLANETLAB_LEAGUE.json` |
| **Faults** (machines dying, spikes, crash loops, noisy neighbours): fewest pages to a human, fastest recovery | simulation, 500 runs per workload | `results/protocol/` |
| **GPU power law** (engine cap over the MLPerf-measured performance law), against native at equal work: energy -27% to -33%, time over the heat limit -73% to -78% | simulation, held-out | `results/hardware/SUMMARY_HELDOUT.json` |
| **Site power exchange (conveyance law, manuscript Ch. 29-31):** 4 GPU groups under one site budget: 0 minutes over the site limit at 70/60/50% budgets (native 10.5/45.6/106); least energy at every budget; 31-115 fewer backlog minutes than the static split | simulation, held-out; law proved (conservation, Lyapunov, exponential convergence) | `docs/CONVEYANCE_LAW.md`, `results/hardware/SITE_EXCHANGE_HELDOUT_*.json` |
| **Live levers under the nervous system:** 19 of 19 checks on real Kubernetes; reset restores everything | live, kind | `results/live/LIVE_LEVERS_2_NERVOUS.txt` |
| **Shadow pilot kit:** a read-only identity made 0 writes across 40 decisions | live, kind | `results/live/LIVE_SHADOW_1.txt` |
| **Safety shield:** 2,000,000 adversarial cases, 0 violations (the test found 2 real bugs, both fixed); C++ twin matches | test | `tests/test_shield_properties.py` |
| **C++ engine:** 100,000,000 decisions, no failures, about 2.3 µs per decision | test | `results/SOAK.json` |

### What still loses, measured

- **C, typical response time, web and four-cluster:** about 20% slower than every platform. Omni fills pods to 80%,
  where the others stop at 70%, and trades response time for energy.
- **C, machine starts and stops:** loses to plain Kubernetes and OpenShift, which hold machines steady and pay for it
  in machine-hours.
- **C, GPU and batch:** energy 1-2% worse and power and heat margins 1-4% worse than the tight packers (AKS/Karpenter,
  CAST AI, Spot).
- **Live, set 3, with a working probe:**
  - Omni kept all 6 machines. Latency near the 500 ms SLO blocks machine release.
  - There is no significant difference from native on anything else, except that C has more waiting pods.
  - The earlier live machine savings (sets 1-2) are withdrawn, because the broken probe had blinded the latency sense
    (`results/live/LIVE_REPS_PROBE_DEFECT.md`).
  - Set 4's decision trail showed why. Latency spikes from pod saturation at load steps kept the service from being
    clean, and the engine's calm stayed under the machine threshold (0.65 against 0.7). Both are addressed by the
    attribution gate and the two-way wiring above; the live test is pending (`results/live/LIVE_REPS_4_DIAGNOSIS.md`).
- **A bound, not a loss:** no controller, even one with perfect foresight, can match both the tightest packer's
  machine-hours and the calmest autoscaler's churn at once (`tuning/bound.py`).

### Two-way nervous system (new, live test pending)

Manuscript Appendix J names delay and dropout handling and feedback interpretation as the nervous system's job. The
live controller now wires both directions (`docs/TWO_WAY_NERVOUS_SYSTEM.md`).

- **Blind senses are detected against the wall clock.** A hung probe was the root cause of the live set 1-2 error.
  - A blind sense feeds the engine's `stale` channel.
  - It blocks every give-back.
- **Commands are read back.** Drift feeds the engine's `drift_ratio`. No new machine release goes out before the
  last one has landed.
- **The machine organ has its own engine view and a release gate.** Pods move first, and the headroom proof uses the
  engine's rho.

**Tests:** 75,000 blind states, 200,000 gate states, 300,000 nervous-system states.

**Live sets 5 and 6 could not run.** From 03:51 UTC GitHub refused every job, including `verify`: runner ID 0, no
steps, failed within about 2 seconds. That is GitHub declining to start runners, which on a private repository is
most often exhausted Actions minutes or a spending limit. It is not a code failure. `python verify.py` passes
locally at this commit.

### The state of play as it stood on 2026-10-06 (moved here whole on 2026-10-07)

### In one paragraph (2026-10-06, Omni v1)

**Omni v1, confirmed three times.** On real Kubernetes, every test ran three times as separate GitHub runs on the frozen
engine, ten pairs each (`docs/OMNI_V1.md`, the six `results/live/V1_*.md` tables). Work inside the response line **+42%
to +48%** in all three runs of the all-four test (18.6 → 27.6 requests a second in run A), confirmed better; the 95th
percentile **−57% to −69%** in every run of the steady, wandering, all-four and fault tests, confirmed better; failed
requests −12% to −13% where load swings, confirmed better; machines −1.5% to −3.4% at steady load and −15% to −24% on
the batch queue, confirmed better, no difference beyond the noise elsewhere; energy a declared model (kind never powers a
machine down); beside a noisy neighbour, no difference beyond the noise on every row. **The Omni index on v1: +26.2%**
on real Kubernetes (`results/OMNI_INDEX.md`; only rows confirmed in all three runs count, a row inside the noise counts
as zero; Azure and the card join when their v1 runs land). The paragraph below is the earlier engine's reading, kept as
the record it was.

Omni-Compass sits on top of Kubernetes and hardware and gets more out of what is already there. On real Kubernetes,
the engine before v1 (the live controller at rules 1-8, commit `353903683009`), ten pairs per test, native against
compass with the same work sent to both:
**41.7% more work handled inside the response line on the same machines** (capacity, all four in one run), responses
**59-64% faster** at the 95th percentile (steady, wandering, all four, faults), 12% fewer failed requests where load
swings, energy equal or lower, and not one pod left without a machine. Machines: up to 2% fewer. Omni gives a machine
back only when a paired trial shows the service no slower without it, and on these clusters one machine fewer made
requests 30-45% slower in most trials, so it kept them and spent them on speed and work (earlier engines without that
check parked 29-36%: `docs/history/`). All of it together, real machines only: **the Omni index +12.9%**
(`results/OMNI_INDEX.md`).

**Omni v1** (`docs/OMNI_V1.md`): the engine is frozen and fingerprinted (`OMNI_V1.json`), and every test above runs
three times on it, as separate GitHub runs (A the result, B and C the replications); each table reads confirmed better,
confirmed worse, no difference beyond the noise, or the runs disagree, and replaces the earlier engine's table as it
lands. Running on v1 now: the Kubernetes suite three times, the batch test, the six organisms at 1, 10, 100 and 1,000
copies with the real cluster inside, the big organisms on rented Azure machines, the Azure steady and burst bill tests,
CityLearn, and the power grid.

**What is shown and what is not.** Shown: more work inside the response line on the same machines (34-52% across the
three capacity runs on earlier engines) and a faster tail, on real Kubernetes. Not yet shown: an energy or cloud-bill
saving on real machines. On kind the machines are containers on one runner, so a machine out of service saves modelled
watts, not a metered bill, and Azure's bill did not move on the earlier engine (`results/live/AKS_BILL.md`); the v1 Azure
runs are the test of that. The current card governor has not run on a real GPU.

The card: the first real run (NVIDIA A10, 2026-10-02) used a card controller since replaced; it is not a result to
stand on. In simulation the current controller (amendment 12) is clearly faster under an operator's power cap (p95
6-7% faster, time over the line 1 point lower) and saves 0.5-3.7% energy on the card's own firmware with p95 even
(`results/sim/gpu_two_wire/`). The real card runs next: one card, the card inside the six organisms, then eight cards.

The 945 muscles (Omni v2; 656 in v1) are models of real control systems. With the real cluster or the real card inside, they show the
mechanism (work the same, energy 0.1-0.2% lower, time over the line lower than native in every organism); they are
never counted in the headline.

| Test (real) | Work | Speed | Machines | Energy | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| All four in one run: load up and down one step at a time, 10 pairs | **+29%** | p95 -62% | **-3.6%** | -0.3% | `results/live/ALL_FOUR.md` |
| Capacity, load rising, 10 pairs | **+48%** | p95 -50% | -1% | -0.3% | `results/live/AMENDMENT_3_RUNS.md` |
| Sets 22-27, same work, 10 pairs each | same, none failed | p95 -55% to -65% | **-29% to -36%** | -0.1% to -0.5% | `results/live/LIVE_REPS_22.md` to `results/live/LIVE_REPS_27.md` |
| Six organisms, cluster inside, 5 pairs each | requests served +0.5% to +6% | p95 -24% to -40% | same to -2% | -0.1% to -0.6% | `results/live/SIX_KUBE.md` |
| Azure AKS, steady load, 5 pairs | same | p95 -20% | same | (billed) same | `results/live/AKS_BILL.md` |

All four in one run is done: every one better and proven in the same run (`results/live/ALL_FOUR.md`). Running now: demand that wanders (up, spike, down, back up,
idle, 10 pairs), the Azure burst bill test, and the 1,000-copy grid of the six organisms on Lambda.

#### The engine now, and what runs on it (2026-10-05)

The live controller is frozen at rules 1-8 (`docs/K8S_COMPASS_PREREGISTRATION.md`, amendments 1-8): rules 5-8 were added
today (a pinned gauge is not a steady demand; coasting; cruise; the emergency brake). Every result above was measured on
an earlier version of the controller, and each names its commit. So that every number comes from one engine, the whole
Kubernetes suite runs again on the frozen engine: all four in one run, demand that wanders, the steady same-work set,
the fault and fairness tests, the batch test, and the six organisms at every size; the Azure burst bill test and the two
big organisms on rented Azure machines too. The card harness changed only in how it judges (amendment 11 of the GPU
preregistration), so the single card and the eight cards run once, on this engine, on Lambda.

Back on the frozen engine so far, ten pairs each:
- **Faults** (`results/live/FAULTS.md`): p95 −60%, mean response −35%, time over the line −23%, pending pods −77%.
  Recovery is faster after every fault: machine down 42 s against 70 s, a blind probe 54 s against 66 s, a runaway pod
  98 s against 105 s, a spike the same.
- **Fairness** (`results/live/FAIRNESS.md`): a noisy neighbour on the same cluster. Mean response −15%, nothing worse,
  and the neighbour's own app no worse. The earlier engine scored −0.3% on the index here; this engine scores +5.6%.

Independent simulator: CityLearn round 1 split (the 2022 battery districts better on bill -4% to -11%, electricity -9%
to -17%, carbon -7% to -14%; the 2020-2021 water-tank districts worse on peaks and ramping), the fix (only the electric
batteries are steered), and round 2 on every untouched district (`docs/CITYLEARN_PREREGISTRATION.md`).

#### Measured on real systems: the newest set, Omni-Compass against Kubernetes as it runs today

**Set 24 (2026-10-02, commit `c908054`) repeats it again: machines in service −31.6%, p95 −60.1%, p99 −64.1%, HPA
replicas −38.6%, 0 failed requests, total CPU including Omni-Compass's own −1.8% (not significant)**
(`results/live/LIVE_REPS_24.md`). Set 23 before it: p95 −62%, replicas −37%, pod starts −64%, 0 failed requests, no
energy or total-CPU difference (`results/live/LIVE_REPS_23.md`). The set-22 table below stands as first measured.

Set 22 (`results/live/LIVE_REPS_22.md`): 10 paired repetitions on real Kubernetes (kind), each pair on one machine,
Kubernetes with its autoscaler alone against the same Kubernetes with Omni-Compass on top. The load is sent at a fixed
rate, so both arms were given **the same work**.

| Result | Kubernetes alone | With Omni-Compass | Change (95% interval) |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| **Energy, parked machines still on at idle power** (declared model, no meter) | 160.3 Wh | 160.1 Wh | **−0.1%, no difference** |
| **Response time, 95th percentile** | 407.9 ms | 158.8 ms | **−61%** (proven) |
| Response time, 99th percentile | 639.4 ms | 245.1 ms | −62% (proven) |
| Response time, mean | 179.9 ms | 98.4 ms | −45% (proven) |
| Failed requests | 0 | 0 | equal |
| Pods waiting to start, pod-minutes | 0.265 | 0.025 | −91% (proven) |
| Replicas, mean | 8.93 | 6.91 | −23% (proven) |
| Machines in service, mean (all stayed powered) | 6 | 4.14 | −31% (proven) |
| CPU used by the service | 1.036 cores | 0.957 cores | −7.6% (proven) |
| Omni's own CPU (its controller and every command it ran) | 0 | 0.070 cores | +0.070 (proven) |
| **CPU used, service and Omni together** | 1.036 cores | 1.026 cores | **−0.9%, no difference** |

- **Same work, much faster answers**, with no failed requests and far less waiting.
- **No energy saving is shown on kind.** Every machine stays powered; energy is a declared model, and counted at the
  idle power a parked machine really draws it is unchanged.
- **No CPU saving once Omni's own cost is counted.** The service used 7.6% less CPU; the controller spent almost all
  of it. Cutting the controller's cost is the next improvement.
- The reset restored every setting in every run.

#### Kubernetes sets 25 and 26 (2026-10-02, 10 paired repetitions each, equal work)

| Run | Machines in service | p95 | Failed | Total CPU incl. Omni's own | Receipt |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Set 25, the engine's allocation law | **−32.3%** | **−57.3%** | 0 / 0 | −0.6% (not significant) | `results/live/LIVE_REPS_25.md` |
| Set 26, the engine's allocation law | **−35.8%** | **−55.4%** | 0 / 0 | −1.5% (not significant) | `results/live/LIVE_REPS_26.md` |
| Set 26, **the compass law in the live controller** | **−17.2%** | **−64.8%** | 0 / 0 | +1.0% (not significant) | same; label by the preregistered rule: **better on machines within the band** |
| Set 27, the engine's allocation law | **−36.6%** | **−53.1%** | 0 / 0 | −0.0% (not significant) | `results/live/LIVE_REPS_27.md` |
| Set 27, **the compass law aligned with the GPU governor** | **−15.9%** | **−65.5%** | 0 / 0 | +0.2% (not significant) | same; label by the preregistered rule: **better on machines within the band** |

Set 27 (running): the compass in the live controller reads the service as the corrected GPU compass does (mean response time,
center 0.4), against native and the allocation law (`docs/K8S_COMPASS_PREREGISTRATION.md`).

#### Measured on a real GPU: the card's own meter (evidence class P)

**First confirmation, NVIDIA A10 on Lambda, 2026-10-02** (`results/gpu/run-20261002T082232Z/GPU_REPS.md`, 10 paired
repetitions × native / watch / Omni, 600 s each, frozen at commit `c908054`, checksums verified). Wire check 7 of 7;
2,144 writes, none refused, every one read back, every arm ended at the start limit; watch equal to native.

| Gauge | Native | Omni | Change (95% interval) |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| **Work per energy** (requests per kJ) | 50.79 | 52.62 | **+3.6% (+2.7% to +4.5%), proven** |
| GPU energy | 69,180 J | 66,790 J | −3.5%, proven |
| Requests served / not served | 3,514 / 0 | 3,514 / 0 | equal |
| **Response time, 95th percentile** | 510 ms | 809 ms | **+58.5%, worse, proven** |

**Result, by rule: ENERGY IMPROVEMENT WITH SERVICE TRADEOFF** (the p95 guardrail of +10% failed). The six organisms
with the same card inside (`results/hil/run-20261002T082232Z/HIL.md`, 3 repetitions each): the card's work per energy
+1.6% to +2.8% in every organism, the same requests, its p95 500 to about 600-935 ms. The cause, from the card's own
samples, was wiring in the governor (amendment 6 of `docs/GPU_PREREGISTRATION.md`): busy bursts served at 736-768 MHz
against 861-889 MHz on its own. Corrected (amendments 6 and 7); the corrected governor has not yet run on a card.

#### Simulated (models: they show the mechanism, not a measurement)

| Result | Where |
|---|---|
| GPU governor with share floor and busy gate (one wire, the power limit), MLPerf-calibrated card: +5.1% and +1.3% work per kJ, p95 within +10% | `results/gpu/sim/after` |
| **Two-wire GPU card under the compass law, corrected governor** (amendments 6-7), 10 seeds and 10 fresh seeds, geometric means: **service** profile work per energy **+6.9% / +3.8%**, energy −6.4% / −3.7%, p95 **−5.9% / −2.3%** (faster), time over the line −0.03 / −0.04 pp; **batch** profile +8.1% / +4.2%, p95 +7.0% / −2.3%; the one-wire governor +0.1%; both wires restored every seed | `results/sim/gpu_two_wire/RESULT.md`, `fresh/` |
| **The six organisms** (Compute 345, Physics 262, Energy 282, Distribution 337, the four stacked 1,226, the whole tower 656), native against the compass law on every muscle, 1,000 paired runs at 1× and at 10× size: work per energy +0.20% to +0.30%, energy −0.21% to −0.32%, work −0.01% to −0.02%, time over the service line **+0.19 to +0.27 pp in every cell (band first not held)**, every knob handed back. 100× and 1,000× are running | `results/scale/GRID.md` |
| Speed lock (speed won elsewhere spent on GPU watts) | `results/gpu/sim/pipeline/` |
| CPU and GPU on one conserved power budget: +1.4% to +5.7% work served against a fixed cap, never over the budget | `results/hardware/NODE_EXCHANGE_*.json`, `docs/CONVEYANCE_LAW.md` |
| GPU groups sharing a site budget: 0 minutes over the budget | `results/hardware/SITE_EXCHANGE_HELDOUT_*.json` |
| Platform leagues, faults, PlanetLab traces, stack benchmark | `tuning/`, `results/protocol/`, `results/` (see `docs/history/BENCHMARK_REPORT.md`) |
| **The 656-muscle tower as organisms**, round 3 (preregistered, 10 seeds; every realm carries the shared spine; Omni as the shipped controller commands): the whole tower native against one governor on top, work per energy **+0.1%, SUPERIOR WITHIN GUARDRAILS**; inside the realms the spine costs service: Energy +0.2% with +1.9 pp violations (tradeoff), Compute 0.0% (+2.1 pp, not established), Distribution −0.1% and Physics −0.7% (**WORSE**). Rounds 1 and 2 kept, superseded | `results/realms/REALMS.md`, `docs/REALM_MUSCLES.md` |

## Appendix C. The Equations in Full


    (1) dE/dt    = -alpha_E E + beta_int + beta_ext + v_eff
    (2) dU/dt    = mu U (1 - U^2) - (dE/dt)/E_max - lambda_U U + u,   |u| <= U_AUTHORITY = 25
    (3) dI_U/dt  = (1 - U) - sigma_1 E - delta S - lambda_I I_U
    (4) v_eff    = cos(omega_B t / 2) * c * tanh(lambda_0 + lambda_1 (U - 0.5) + lambda_2 S)
    (5) Phi(S)   = alpha_s S^2 / 2 + beta_s S^3 / 4 - delta S
    (6) dS/dt    = -dPhi/dS = delta - alpha_s S - (3/4) beta_s S^2
    (7) dB/dt    = B_dot ;  dB_dot/dt = gamma_c delta S - (omega_B / Q_B) B_dot - omega_B^2 B
    (8) R_B[n]   = finite-difference audit of (7); never fed back into the state

    Control (one micro step, zero-order hold across all four RK4 stages):
        u = clip(-f_U(x, t) + K_P (sigma - U), -U_AUTHORITY, +U_AUTHORITY),  K_P = 12,  sigma in {-1, +1}

    The compass (every muscle):
        p = position of the service reading in its band (0 calm, 1 the line)
        F = A tanh((K_P (p - center) + K_D v) / A),   K_D >= critical damping
        p >= 0.95  =>  full up force; down side held
        knob <- clip(knob + g_side F span, cover)

    The GPU governor (two wires, omni_controller/gpu_compass.py; one law, amendments 8 to 10):
        p = (mean response of the last 5 s - S) / (SLO - S),  S = SLO / 10;  p95 >= SLO, a failure, blind  =>  fail up
        fail up / race (utilization >= 0.95)  =>  ceiling = top clock, lid = start limit (the card's own settings)
        steady under the limit (saturated and drawing >= 0.97 of the limit)  =>  ceiling = the card's own busy clock,
            lid = start limit (the same watts, no knock-backs)
        otherwise:
            ceiling <- clip(ceiling + round(g_side F f_top / 15 MHz) 15 MHz, c_floor, f_top)
            c_floor = max(f_busy_own x floor, f_top - k* 15 MHz)       (never under the card's own busy clock,
                                                                         never past the verdict's deepest step k*)
            lid = clip(ceil(1.10 P_busy_own), envelope floor, start limit)
        g_up 0.10, g_down 0.0125, center 0.4, floor 1.00

    The verdict (omnicompass/verdict.py; every slow knob, the GPU ceiling and the Kubernetes machine count):
        reference r = the median cost per request at the deepest allowed step, measured fresh, n >= 30 requests
        trial t     = the median cost at one step past it, n >= 30 requests, under the same traffic
        allow the step  iff  t <= r (1 + a)  and  t <= c_native (1 + a),   a = 0.02
        a refused step is not tried again for R decisions (GPU R = 900; Kubernetes 120); the knob never goes past the
        deepest allowed step, so steps cannot add up beyond the allowance

    Kubernetes, the compass on the HPA target (omni_controller/controller.py; sets 30 and 31):
        target x in [0.6 x_op, x_op] (times the conveyed gain); the up force lowers x (more pods)
        p >= 0.95 from load (line breached, every sense live, nothing pending)  =>  x = 0.6 x_op at once
        p >= 0.95 from a blind sense or pods waiting for a lost machine           =>  x = x_op (native's own)
        fault over (p < center, line clean, nothing pending)                      =>  x = x_op at once, never held
        machines: one more at once past the wall; one back only when the verdict and the release gate agree
        g_up 0.10, g_down 0.02, release force < -0.2

    The productivity arithmetic (every receipt; manual section 3.4):
        work W equal in both arms;  G = C_native / C_omni - 1;  the same work needs 1/(1 + G) of the resources;
        saving S = G / (1 + G):  G = 1/3  <=>  S = 1/4

## Appendix D. Metrics


Every gauge, where it comes from, and whether it is measured or modelled: `docs/METRICS_CATALOG.md`. The gauges that
appear in the three-run tables of this manual, with their source and their direction, are these:

| Gauge | Source | Measured or modelled | Direction |
|---|---|---|---|
| work inside the response line (requests, transactions or messages a second answered within the line) | the probe's own records, pgbench's log, the consumers' records, the application's records | measured | higher is better; the product number |
| response time, mean, median, 95th and 99th percentile | the same | measured | lower is better |
| time over the response line (share of samples) | the same, against the preregistered line | measured | lower is better |
| failed requests, lost messages | the same | measured | any increase is WORSE |
| worker machines in service, mean; node-hours | the cluster's own node records every 15 s | measured (machine-hours on kind; Azure's own count on AKS) | lower is better |
| compute bill at list price | Azure's own machine count × list price per family | measured (a real bill) | lower is better |
| energy (Wh), the standby model | a declared formula over the machines in service (kind) | **modelled**, said so on every line | lower is better |
| host CPU busy; host CPU-seconds; CPU-seconds per 1,000 units inside the line | `/proc/stat` of the real machine under the test | measured | lower is better |
| Omni's own CPU (cores), mean | the governor's audit (its process and every command it ran) | measured | shown, not judged in the Kubernetes tables; a confirmed loss where it is one |
| connections held open, consumers running, memory ceiling held | the pooler's, the group's, the cache's own reports | measured | lower is better (the resource held) |
| cache hit rate; consumer lag | Redis's INFO; the consumers' records | measured | higher is better; lower is better |
| HPA replicas, pods started, pod start wait | the API server's own records | measured | shown, not judged except pod start wait |
| organism work, energy, time over its line | the organism's plant models | **modelled** | by direction; S class |
| energy a mission, missions a charge (drones) | the simulator's motor constants through a declared model | **modelled** | lower; higher |
| handed back (every arm) | the knob read back at the end of the arm | measured | yes in every arm, or the run is invalid |
| off the clock | the organism's own clock against its window | measured | shown; marks the cell |


## Appendix E. Troubleshooting


| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Wire check `FAIL 3 up wire (lock)` | the driver or VM refuses clock locking | use bare metal or full passthrough; or run the one-wire governor |
| Wire check `FAIL 3 up wire (follows down)` | the card ignores the ceiling | update the driver; check for another management agent holding clocks |
| Wire check `FAIL 4 down wire` | the power limit is refused or capped by the board | check `nvidia-smi -q -d POWER`; run as root |
| `another copy of this test is already running` | a second copy was started | wait for the first or reboot; start once |
| `something else is using the GPU` | another process holds the card | stop it; the benchmark must run alone |
| Governor exit 5 | another writer changed a knob | find the other controller; Omni-Compass left its value alone |
| Governor exit 3 | a restore did not read back | restore by hand (`nvidia-smi -rgc`, `-pl <start>`); investigate before rerunning |
| `decision failed (n in a row)` | the cluster API is unreachable | turn it OFF; native runs on |
| Energy saved but p95 slower than native | the card served bursts below its own clock, or the lid sat under its own draw | read section 8.5; in the audit compare `telemetry.clock_mhz` while busy with `native_busy_clock_mhz`, and `want_w` with `native_busy_draw_w` |
| Fail-up in most decisions | `--slo-ms` set too low for the workload, or a stale feed read as blind | set `--slo-ms` from the workload's own target; check the feed's age |
| No saving at all, service unchanged | the card is saturated almost all the time (it races), or the service sits above the compass's center | expected on a card with no slack; the saving comes from the quiet stretches |
| Kubernetes: no machine ever given back | the release gate refuses (its reason is in the audit), or the service is above the compass's center | read `node_gate.reason` in the audit; check `--slo-ms` and the latency feed |
| Kubernetes: a repetition marked OFF THE CLOCK | the machine could not step the organism inside its window | a longer window for that size on that machine; never a faster reading of the same run |
| Broker: consumers climb to the cover and stay | messages wait at every step (the producer is past the group's capacity) | the benchmark's capacity step sets the peak at nine tenths of the operator's group; check the measured capacity in the run's log |
| Cache: the ceiling grows while little memory is used | cold misses read as pressure | the full-cache gate is the rule (used ≥ 90% of the ceiling); check `used_mb` beside `maxmemory_mb` in the run's log |
| Cache: the ceiling never grows | the working set fits the operator's ceiling | expected: a cache that fits has nothing for the ceiling to mend, and the row reads inside the noise |
| Swarm: a cell reads "void" | two drones came within two collision radii in either arm | a task or simulator setting (keep-out, altitude stagger, depot spacing); fixed before any counted run and said in the preregistration |
| Three-run table heads itself with a warning | a run's commit is not the engine it claims, or the three are not separate runs | run `tools/omni_version.py --commit <sha>` on each; make the table only from runs on one frozen engine |
| Archive bot skips a run | the run was not finished when the bot passed | leave the id in `.github/archive_request.txt`; the next pass copies it |


## Appendix F. Evidence Map


`docs/EVIDENCE_LEDGER.md` (every claim and its class), `docs/CLAIMS_REGISTER.md` (what is claimed and what is not),

`docs/SWARM_PREREGISTRATION.md`, `docs/CITYLEARN_PREREGISTRATION.md`, `docs/PANDAPOWER_PREREGISTRATION.md` and
`docs/ROBOTICS_PREREGISTRATION.md` (the rules written before each run), `docs/OMNI_V1.md` to `OMNI_V3.md` (every
result by engine), `docs/REGISTER.md` (every benchmark and its file), `docs/PROOF_PROGRAM.md` (the program to full size

`docs/STATE_OF_PLAY.md` (where everything stands), `docs/HANDOFF.md` (every command in one page).

**How to audit one result from this manual to its raw files.** Take any row of section 16. Its source column names a
three-run table in `results/live/`; the table's head names the three GitHub run ids, the commit each ran on and the engine
`tools/omni_version.py` reads at that commit. Each run id names a folder `results/live/raw/run-<id>/` holding every
repetition's files (the capture, the response times, the governor's audit and log, the per-request records, one SHA-256
manifest per repetition). The table tool named in the table's text (`tools/confirm_abc.py` or its siblings) rebuilds the
table from those folders; `tools/omni_index.py` rebuilds the index from the tables; `tools/dossier.py` rebuilds the
dossier. The preregistration named in the table's text holds the rules, written before the first counted run, with every
amendment dated. Nothing in that chain is by hand.

A **muscle** is one setting on one machine that already has its own control: a replica target, a node pool's size, a GPU's clock ceiling, a chiller's setpoint, a battery's reserve, a joint's effort. Omni-Compass does not replace that control. It reads the machine's meters, computes one bounded force with the compass law, and moves the setting the machine already accepts, through a plug that reads the setting once before the first write, reads back every write, steps aside if another controller moves it, and puts it back at the end.

This chapter lists all 945 muscles of the catalog (`realms/catalog.csv`). For each one it says what kind of machine it is, which of the four kinds of knob it is, what Omni-Compass reads and does with it, how such a muscle is reached in a real stack, and which organisms it belongs to. The plants behind the benchmark numbers are models of these machines (evidence class **S**); a muscle in this list is wired on a real system only through the levels and the checks of the manual (chapters 8 and 9). See `DISCLOSURES.md`.

### How to read an entry

**The four kinds of knob.**

- **capacity**: how much of the machine is in service (replicas, instances, units, speed). Omni-Compass writes it.
- **admission**: what is let in (queues, rate limits, admission control). Omni-Compass reads it and leaves it to its own controller in the current law; it is counted, never written.
- **power**: the power share or limit the machine may draw. Omni-Compass writes it inside its cover.
- **setpoint**: the target the machine's own loop holds (a temperature, a reserve, a process value). Omni-Compass moves it inside its safe band.

**The five kinds of plant.** Every muscle is modelled on one of five plants, each with its own service reading and lever:

| Plant | What it is | What Omni-Compass reads | What Omni-Compass moves |
|---|---|---|---|
| `compute_pool` | a pool of servers, pods, GPUs, links or disks serving a stream of requests or jobs | how far its queue and its load sit toward the service line (queue or lateness, and load above half) | the capacity it may use: its replica or instance count (through its autoscaler's target or floor), its power share, or one unit given back through the release gate |
| `thermal_zone` | a data hall or building zone cooled by chillers, air handlers or fans | its temperature against its limit | its supply setpoint (colder is more cooling), its power share, or one cooling unit given back when the room has margin |
| `energy_storage` | a battery, UPS or microgrid store with a load and a grid connection | its draw on the grid connection and its reserve | its reserve setpoint (how much charge it holds back); its power limit is left native |
| `motion_axis` | a motor-driven axis: a robot joint, a flight-control surface, a reaction wheel, a traction motor | its tracking error and its load | its speed and effort share, or its power share |
| `process_loop` | a regulated process: a temperature, pressure, flow, level, voltage or composition held at a setpoint | how far the process sits from its band | its setpoint within its safe band, its actuator range, or its power share |

**The organisms.** The 945 muscles build six organisms: each of the four realms (every muscle whose realm list includes it), the four stacked with every duplicate kept (1,716), and the whole tower with every muscle once (945). A muscle of the shared spine sits in all four realms.

| Organism | Muscles |
|---|---:|
| Compute / AI / Cloud | 430 |
| Physics / Robotics / Autonomous | 376 |
| Energy / Facility / Industrial | 470 |
| Distribution / Specialized | 440 |
| The four stacked, every duplicate kept | 1,716 |
| The whole tower, every muscle once | 945 |

### The shared spine: 257 muscles in all four realms

The machines every realm stands on: servers, machines, GPUs and CPUs, network, storage, observability, security, cooling and electrical distribution. Each spine muscle is part of every realm's organism, counted once in the tower and four times in the stack.

#### Cloud VM & Capacity (21 muscles)

Each is a pool of servers, pods, GPUs, links or disks serving a stream of requests or jobs; its class is `node` (a fleet of machines or VMs that boot in minutes), reached through the node pool's size command (Karpenter, Cluster Autoscaler, MachineSet, cloud ASG). Omni-Compass reads how far its queue and its load sit toward the service line (queue or lateness, and load above half). It belongs to every organism.

#### Container Resources (23 muscles)

Each is a pool of servers, pods, GPUs, links or disks serving a stream of requests or jobs; its class is `server` (an application service on servers or pods), reached through the Kubernetes API (HPA target and floor, pod resize). Omni-Compass reads how far its queue and its load sit toward the service line (queue or lateness, and load above half). It belongs to every organism.
