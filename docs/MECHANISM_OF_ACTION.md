## 1. The state: six numbers that describe the whole system

| Symbol | Name | What it stands for in a data centre |
|---|---|---|
| E | energy / excitation | how hard the system is being driven: queues, overload, power, heat |
| U | order parameter | how healthy and settled the system is: +1 healthy basin, -1 failed basin |
| I_U | integrated need | unmet need accumulated over time: memory of pressure that has not been relieved |
| S | stress | slow structural stress from heat, power, network, security, staleness |
| B, B_dot | bath and its rate | a damped oscillator driven by stress: the slow "tide" of physical load |

## 2. The equations (omnicompass/core.py, lines 5-12)

```
(1) dE/dt    = -alpha_E E + beta_int + beta_ext + v_eff
(2) dU/dt    = mu U (1 - U^2) - (dE/dt)/E_max - lambda_U U + u,          |u| <= 25
(3) dI_U/dt  = (1 - U) - sigma_1 E - delta S - lambda_I I_U
(4) v_eff    = cos(omega_B t / 2) * c * tanh(lambda_0 + lambda_1 (U - 0.5) + lambda_2 S)
(5) Phi(S)   = alpha_s S^2 / 2 + beta_s S^3 / 4 - delta S
(6) dS/dt    = -dPhi/dS = delta - alpha_s S - (3/4) beta_s S^2
(7) dB/dt    = B_dot ;   dB_dot/dt = gamma_c delta S - (omega_B / Q_B) B_dot - omega_B^2 B
(8) R_B[n]   = finite-difference audit of (7), never fed back
```

Each term does one job:

- **(1) Energy.** Energy decays at rate alpha_E = 3.487. It is driven by two forcings: internal pressure `beta_int` (queue and
  overload) and external pressure `beta_ext` (power, heat, network, staleness, security). The drive term `v_eff` (4) is
  bounded by `c` through the hyperbolic tangent, so no input can drive E without limit. This is the saturation (the tanh
  "speed limit"): however extreme the observation, the engine's response rate is capped at c = 1.
- **(2) Order.** `mu U (1 - U^2)` is a double-well (bistable) drift with two stable basins, U = +1 (healthy) and
  U = -1 (failed), and an unstable ridge at U = 0. A rise in energy (`dE/dt`) pushes U out of the healthy basin. `u` is
  the bounded control input.
- **(3) Integrated need.** I_U grows while U is below 1 (the system is not settled). It is reduced by energy and stress
  already being dealt with, and it leaks at lambda_I = 0.719. It is the engine's memory of unrelieved pressure.
- **(5)-(6) Stress.** A cubic potential (the "well in the basin"). S rolls downhill to its stable root. This is the
  slowest restoring force.
- **(7) Bath.** A damped harmonic oscillator (natural frequency omega_B = 1, quality Q_B = 2.5) driven by stress. It turns
  stress into a smooth, lagged "tide". It is the only second-order element.
- **(8) Audit.** The bath equation is re-checked numerically every step. The check is never fed back.

Integration: classical 4th-order Runge-Kutta, 10 micro-steps of 0.01 per macro step (`rk4_step`, `macro_step`). The C++
twin matches the Python to 3.6e-15 on 500 reference trajectories.

## 3. From telemetry to state (omnicompass/adapter.py, `observe_vector`, `assimilate`)

Each decision the telemetry is normalised to nine observations: q (queue), load, power, thermal, network, drift, stale,
security, conflict. An observed state is computed from them:

```
E_obs   = 0.25 q + 0.18 max(0, load - 0.85) + 0.16 power + 0.13 thermal + 0.10 network + 0.08 drift + 0.06 conflict + 0.04 stale
U_obs   = 1 - (0.27 q + 0.18 power + 0.16 thermal + 0.12 network + 0.12 drift + 0.10 conflict + 0.05 stale)
S_obs   = 0.36 thermal + 0.28 power + 0.18 network + 0.10 security + 0.08 stale - 0.20 q
B_obs   = 0.52 power + 0.26 thermal + 0.22 drift
I_obs   = q + drift + conflict
beta_int = 0.58 q + 0.42 max(0, load - 0.75)        beta_ext = 0.33 power + 0.27 thermal + 0.20 network + 0.12 stale + 0.08 security
```

The state is blended toward the observed state with weight a = 0.339: `x <- (1 - a) x + a x_obs`. It is then evolved
by one macro step (0.1 engine time units) of equations (1)-(7).

## 4. From state to action (the allocation law, `Governor.step`)

```
push     = u(x) / 25,  u(x) = clip(-f_U(x) + 12 (1 - U), -25, 25)        equation (2)'s controller, evaluated, not applied
rho*     = clamp(rho0 - kI I_U - kE E, rho_min, rho0)                      target utilisation (the HPA target)
n_req    = ceil(n load / rho*) + ceil(kq q n)                               machines wanted
release  only while push <= push_release (the engine reports convergence), after band and dwell
cap      = clamp(cap_now load (1 + margin), cap_min, 1) when calm and U >= U_gate; 1 under backlog;
           always <= 1 - cap_gain max(0, B - B_cap)                         the bath limits the power cap
change   permitted only while U >= U_gate and no security block
rollback authorised if S >= S_rollback, U is falling, or a security block is seen
```

## 5. Which equation drives which muscle

| Muscle | Engine quantity used | Where |
|---|---|---|
| HPA target (pods) | rho* from I_U and E, equations (1) and (3) | adapter `Governor.step`; live `omni_controller/controller.py` |
| Node pool (machines) | n_req from load, queue and rho*; release gated by push from equation (2) | same |
| Power cap (pod CPU limits, CPU frequency, GPU limit) | cap from U gate and bath B, equation (7) | same; `omni_controller/muscles.py` |
| Rollout guard | change_permitted (U), rollback (S, dU) | `muscles.py` |
| Security hold | security observation raises S and blocks expansion | adapter, shield |
| Speed-first law | rho* for pods; push gates machine release | `omnicompass/speed.py` |
| Right-sizing | rho* sizes CPU; E widens the memory margin; push gates scale-in | `omnilab/rightsize.py` |
| Cold start | rho* sizes instances; I_U sets how long to keep warm | `omnilab/coldstart.py` |
| GPU packing | I_U pre-warms nodes; push gates power-off | `omnilab/gpupack.py` |
| Training power | E tightens the applied ramp limit under sustained grid stress | `omnilab/powersmooth.py` |
| GPU health | S and E shorten the checkpoint interval | `omnilab/health.py` |
| Cooling | E widens the inlet-temperature margin | `omnilab/cooling.py` |
| Inference | the full allocation law (node_delta) sizes replicas | `omnilab/inference.py` |
| Agent containment | I_U throttles; the security observation contains | `omnilab/containment.py` |
| VM energy | I_U and E raise the learning rate when attribution goes stale | `omnilab/vmenergy.py` |

## 6. Measured: what the equations actually do inside the governor

Measured on a real observation stream (fleet plant, web services, fleet mode, 360 decisions):

| Mode (eigenvalue of the Jacobian at the operating point) | Time constant | In decisions |
|---|---|---|
| -7.90 | 0.13 | 1.3 |
| -3.10 | 0.32 | 3.2 |
| -0.72 | 1.39 | 13.9 |
| -0.20 +/- 0.98i (the bath) | 5.0, period 6.4 | 50, rings every 64 decisions |
| -0.17 | 6.0 | 60 |

- **Every mode is stable** (all real parts negative). The operating point is a stable equilibrium inside the healthy basin:
  E = 0.095, U = 0.976, S = 0.315, B = 0.10. This is the basin keeping everything in, stated as mathematics.
- **Per decision, the equations and the observation move the state about equally.** Across all six variables the
  equations contribute 45-50% of each step's movement and the observation blend the rest.
- **Equation (2)'s control input u is not applied during governance.** The engine evolves open-loop (u = 0). The control
  law is evaluated only to produce `push`, which decides when capacity may be released.
- **Compute:** about 95 microseconds per decision in Python, and about 2.9 microseconds in the C++ twin.

## 7. What this explains, and what it points to

- **Why "engine off" scores close to "engine on" in the muscle benchmarks.** With the equations frozen, the observation
  blend still moves the state. Both versions are then low-pass filters of the same telemetry. The engine's fast modes
  (1-3 decisions) behave almost like the blend itself. Its distinct contribution is its slow memory: I_U (14 decisions),
  S (60) and the bath (period 64 decisions). The muscle mappings mostly read E and rho*, which live on the fast modes.
- **The engine clock is not matched to the workload's rhythm.** One decision advances engine time by 0.1. At 60-second
  decisions the bath rings every 64 minutes, but web demand has a 24-hour rhythm and training power a 2-second one. This
  is a wiring choice in the adapter (engine time per decision), not a property of the equations.
- **The controller in equation (2) is unused as an actuator.** Wiring its output u (or U's trajectory under u) directly
  to the actuators is the unexplored way to "let the math do the work".

Three wiring experiments follow directly. None changes a single equation:

1. **Clock matching.** Set engine time per decision so that the bath's natural period equals the workload's rhythm.
   The oscillator in (7) then carries the cycle and can anticipate it.
2. **Slow-mode actuation.** Drive machines from I_U, S and B (the memory modes) rather than E (a fast mode).
3. **Closed-loop actuation.** Apply equation (2)'s u and use its magnitude, not only its sign, as the actuator command.

Each is testable in the existing harness against every platform in the league (tuning/league.py), and will be tested
there.
