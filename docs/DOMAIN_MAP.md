Every system Omni-Compass can sit on, what it reads, what it pushes, the reflexes that bound it, and where it stands.

## 1. The connector pattern

Omni-Compass is the same engine on every muscle. Each muscle gets one connector with five parts:

| Part | Role | Example (compute) |
|---|---|---|
| Afferent (sense) | What the muscle reports | load, pending work, power, heat |
| Engine | Equations (1)-(7) turn readings into state: error E, coherence U, pressure I_U, stress S, bath B | same six-state engine everywhere |
| Efferent (push) | The equation (2) law and allocation law drive the muscle toward convergence | node count, HPA target, power cap |
| Reflex (shield) | Hard limits checked before any push | never below pod requests, step limits, power limit |
| Kill | Control returns to the muscle's own controllers | restore HPA targets, observe only |

Fit tiers used below:
- **Direct**: Omni can govern the muscle as a supervisory controller.
- **Supervisory**: Omni governs budgets, schedules and envelopes; the muscle's own real-time controller stays in charge of fast inner loops.
- **Advisory**: regulated or safety-critical; Omni recommends until certified (IEC 61508, DO-178C, ISO 26262, medical and financial regulation).
- **Not Omni's problem**: a different kind of problem; stated so no one claims otherwise.

Status: **Wired** (in code, verified), **Partial**, **Open** (connector not yet built).

## 2. Digital infrastructure

| Observability pipelines | data volume, cost | sampling, retention | required audit data | Direct | Open |

## 3. AI

| Muscle | Reads | Pushes | Reflexes | Fit | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| Carbon-aware AI | grid price and carbon intensity | when and where training runs | deadlines | Direct | Open |

### AI alignment: what Omni can and cannot do

Alignment has two parts, and only one is Omni's.

| Part | What it means | Omni's role |
|---|---|---|
| **Value alignment** | The model itself wants and does what people intend: honest, safe, helpful behaviour learned in training | **Not Omni's problem.** A governor outside the model cannot make the model's goals or judgement correct. |
| **Control and containment** | Whatever the model wants, it can only act within bounds: resources, permissions, spend, network reach, a kill that works | **Direct.** This is a governance problem: sense what the agent is doing, bound what it may spend and touch, revoke instantly, keep an audit trail. |

Omni-Compass can be the boundary layer AI runs inside. It cannot be the thing that makes AI trustworthy. Claims must keep that line.

## 8. Order of wiring

1. Digital infrastructure: GPUs, CPU power states, memory, storage, network, job queues, multi-region.
2. Facilities and energy: cooling plant, power distribution, batteries, demand response.
3. AI: training power smoothing, inference serving, model routing, agent containment.
4. Physical operations, then science and space as supervisors.
5. Regulated domains as advisors, until certified.

Each connector follows the same path as compute: wired, benchmarked against today's controls, verified, pre-registered, tested on held-out scenarios, then released.
