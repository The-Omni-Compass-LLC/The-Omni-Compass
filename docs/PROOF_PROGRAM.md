See `LICENSE`, `NOTICE` and `DISCLOSURES.md`.

Written 2026-10-07 on the founder's order: the strongest evidence that can be built, at the largest size each platform
allows, on open native engines the industry itself runs, so that the only step left to a buyer is to run the same
harness on their own system and read the same table. This document is the program of record. Each line of it becomes a
preregistration before it runs, then a workflow, then a report with every row shown, losses included, then a line in the
register (`docs/REGISTER.md`) and a chapter in the manual (`docs/OMNI_COMPASS_MANUAL.md`).

## 1. The rules every item obeys

1. **Two arms, no third.** Native is the system on its own controller, as shipped or as its operator set it. Omni is
   Omni-Compass on top of that same controller. Omni never replaces native and is never run alone.
2. **Do no harm.** Where Omni cannot improve a knob, the knob stays native. The 2% verdict is the engine's trigger.
3. **The engine is frozen.** Omni v3 (`OMNI_V3.json`, digest `b53d05449ee04c4b`). Nothing in this program changes a
   rule, a gain, a guard, a preset or a muscle. A change would make the next version and every result would run again.
4. **Preregistered.** Rules frozen on one tuning case, written down and pushed before the untouched cases run.
5. **Three runs, three readings.** A, B and C as separate GitHub runs on the same commit. Every judged row reads
   *confirmed better*, *confirmed worse*, *no difference beyond the noise* (with the count of runs it holds in) or *the
   runs disagree*. Never "not confirmed".
6. **Every row shown.** Losses included. A benchmark may be left unpublished; it is never published with rows cut out.
7. **Evidence classes.** P (a physical meter), L (live software), S (our own models). S is never presented as proof.
8. **The clock.** An organism keeps its measured window's clock; a repetition where either arm ended more than 5% of the
   window late is marked OFF THE CLOCK and the window is lengthened for that size on that machine.
9. **Handed back.** Every knob returns to the snapshot taken at the start, checked at the end of every arm.
10. **Raw files kept.** Every artifact archived with the code under `results/live/raw/run-<id>/` with SHA-256 sums.

## 2. The sizes

| Platform | Free size (GitHub) | Paid size | How |
|---|---|---|---|
| Kubernetes, real cluster (kind) | 6 workers, 10 pairs × 3 runs; the six organisms at 1, 10 and 100 copies | the organisms at 1,000 copies on a rented machine, the window set to keep the clock | `six-kube`, `benchmark-reps`, `big-organism-detached` |
| Kubernetes, simulated nodes (KWOK) | 50, 500 and 1,000 nodes | | `kwok-scale` |
| The modelled organisms | 1, 10, 100 and 1,000 copies × 1 to 1,000 runs (the grid) | | `six` |
| Azure's managed Kubernetes | | the largest fleet the allowance gives: 15 workers today (32 cores), 96 at 200 cores once a machine family is granted; the app's ceiling 9 pods a worker | `aks-metered` (`max_workers`, `hpa_max`), `azure-quota` |
| GPU | | one card; one card inside 1,000 copies; eight cards; vLLM serving (Lambda) | `scripts/gpu_*.sh`, `tools/run_hil.py` |
| CPU power, a real meter | | one rented bare-metal machine, RAPL energy counters | to build |
| Drone swarms | 20 drones | 100 and more on a rented machine | **done, A/B/C on v3** (`results/live/V3_SWARM.md`): energy a mission −7% to −20%, missions a charge +8% to +25%, confirmed better, no collision; 100 drones on a rented machine next |
| Databases, messaging, caches, search, storage, big data | the service in a container on a 4-core runner, three untouched workloads each | | `pgbench` done; the rest to build |
| Independent simulators (grid, buildings, robots, batteries, process, water, wind, traffic) | every case the simulator ships | | `pandapower`, `citylearn`, `mujoco` done; the rest to build |

## 3. The benchmarks, in the order they run

Status words: **done** (A, B, C in the repo), **running**, **queued** (dispatched or next in line), **to build** (harness
and preregistration not yet written). Every "to build" item names the open native engine Omni will sit on top of.

### 3.1 Compute, AI and cloud

### 3.5 Added 10 October 2026 at the founder's sweep: nothing with value left out

The founder asked that no domain with value be missed, and asked again the same day with cars, self-driving, batteries, nuclear
energy, power plants, medicine and surgery named; the second check is written as `docs/COVERAGE_MAP.md`, every domain against the
register. Aerospace and rockets were already there (the register's rows 32 to 36),
operating systems, television and telecom, satellites and signals, energy, oil and minerals, finance, the platforms and social
media, science and physics, robotics to the top. Each row below is an open benchmark anyone can run, with a shipped controller
for native and one knob for Omni; each gets its own preregistration before its first run; the register's section 4 carries the
same rows (38 to 57) with their owners. Where no open source with a shipped controller is confirmed yet, the row says
"candidate" and names nothing.

## 4. The defensibility package

| Item | What it is | Status |
|---|---|---|
| One-command replication kit | from any pushed commit, one command reruns any benchmark above on GitHub and prints the same table; the commit, the engine fingerprint and the raw files' sums are in the table's head | to build |
| Evidence dossier, one per benchmark | preregistration, commit, engine, run ids, raw files and sums, the table, the losses, the index line | mostly in place; to be made uniform and indexed from `docs/REGISTER.md` |
| Reviewer protocol | the written path a human auditor follows from the register to a raw file and back | to write |
| Independent readers | ChatGPT and Grok read results; they never produce them (`results/external_review/`) | in place |
| Security review of the controllers | what Omni can touch, what it provably cannot, the kill switch, the dead-man lease, the permissions it holds | to write |
| The manual | every chapter above, the wiring stack by stack, the readings, the results, the file map | to rewrite (`docs/OMNI_COMPASS_MANUAL.md`, PDF rebuilt) |

## 5. Schedule and budget

| Weeks | Work | Compute cost |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | finish the running work; Azure at the largest fleet granted; the manual rewrite; traces (4); robustness (9) | about $200 |
| 2 | swarms (29), Kafka (12), YCSB (11), the real meter (6) | about $20 |
| 3 | Redis, OpenSearch, Spark, fio, Karpenter and KEDA (5), BOPTEST (20), PyBaMM (21) | about $20 |
| 4 | the rest of the queue, the replication kit, the reviewer protocol, the security review; the GPU runs on Lambda when the founder gives the go | about $60 |

Build time is the binding cost: two to three days per new benchmark, several in parallel on GitHub. Every result is
pushed as it lands, wins and losses alike, and reported to the founder in plain tables.

## 6. Disclosures

- Omni-Compass is a supervisory governor evaluated on top of native controllers. Nothing here is a production
  deployment, a product warranty, or advice to operate any system.
- Results of class S are models. They are labelled as such everywhere they appear and are never presented as proof.
- Results of class L and P are measured on the named open systems at the named sizes and commits. They do not by
  themselves establish the same effect on any other system; the replication kit exists so that a buyer can establish it
  on theirs.
- Negative and null results are published with the same prominence as positive ones. A benchmark may be withheld by the
  founder; it is never published with rows removed.
- The engine's version fingerprints are bookkeeping. The engine that stands when the founder declares it final is
  published as Omni-Compass 1.0; earlier fingerprints go to `docs/history`.
- All patent applications, copyright registrations and trademark applications have been filed in the United States by The
  Omni-Compass LLC. Numbers are not given here.
